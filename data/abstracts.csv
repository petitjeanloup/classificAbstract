This study assesses the barriers towards the implementation of a PS market in Greek kiwi production systems by conducting two separate quantitative surveys, one for beekeepers and one for kiwi producers. The field survey findings corroborate the existence of a strong basis for further collaboration between the two stakeholders, as both of them acknowledge the importance of PS. Moreover, the farmers' willingness to pay and the beekeepers' willingness to receive regarding the renting of their hives for PS were examined. The kiwi is a highly insect-pollinated dependent crop and is the cornerstone of the Greek agricultural sector, rendering the country as the fourth biggest kiwi producer worldwide, with an expected increase in national production the following years. This extensive transformation of the Greek arable land to Kiwi monocultures in combination with a worldwide shortage of pollination services due to the wild pollinators' decline raises questions for the provision of pollination services, and consequently, for the sustainability of the sector. In many countries, this shortage of pollination services has been addressed by the installation of pollination services markets, such as those in the USA and France. Therefore, this study tries to identify the barriers towards the implementation of a pollination services market in Greek kiwi production systems by conducting two separate quantitative surveys, one for beekeepers and one for kiwi producers. The findings showed a strong basis for further collaboration between the two stakeholders, as both of them acknowledge the importance of pollination services. Moreover, the farmers' willingness to pay and the beekeepers' willingness to receive of the beekeepers regarding the renting of their hives for pollination services were examined.

Agroforestry systems can effectively buffer the adverse climate conditions and stabilize or even increase crop yield under climate change. However, the positive effects of agroforestry remain uncertain due to the possible intense competition between trees and crops, especially for legume crops that have been less studied than cereals in such context. This study aimed to assess the response of the phenology, growth, grain yield, and yield-related traits of chickpea (Cicer arietinum), faba bean (Vicia faba), and lentil (Lens culinaris) to olive-based agroforestry (AFS) as compared to sole crops system (SCS) in the South of the Mediterranean. We conducted a field experiment during two growing seasons marked by an intense drought, either at the beginning (year 1) or at the end (year 2) of the crop cycle. Crop growth and yield were lower in year 1 than in year 2, reflecting the adverse growing conditions caused by the early drought. They were also lower in AFS than in SCS for both years, indicating that trees had competitive effects on crops. In year 1, the yield loss of grains in AFS was 66 % for lentil, 47 % for chickpea, and 43 % for faba bean compared to SCS, confirming the greater shade sensitivity of lentil. In year 2, the reduction was significantly smaller and was about 46 %, 34 %, 38 % for lentil, chickpea and, faba bean, respectively. The number of pods and grains were the most affected yield components by agroforestry and drought timing across the three legumes crops. Similar responses were found when comparing crops at different distances to trees within the AFS field. Crops generally had lower biomass and yield, explained by fewer pods and grains, on the northern side of trees compared to the southern side of trees or the middle of tree inter-rows, causing significant spatial heterogeneity in crops. However, lentil and chickpea had a positive response to shade during the early drought year while a negative response during the late drought year, suggesting that the benefits of the microclimate created by olive trees express depending on drought timing and crop physiology. Our study supports legume integration into AFS, suggesting that chickpea should be considered during high-stress conditions, while faba bean should be preferred during low-stress conditions.(c) 2023 The Authors.

This work aims at characterizing their diversity and performance. To this end, 72 farmers surveys were conducted in the Moulay Driss Zerhoun region (Morocco). For each farm, agroforestry plots were compared to corresponding monocrops and pure olive orchards. Under rainfed conditions, the insertion of legumes and cereals in olive orchards is the dominant association. There are very significant differences in yields of annual crops and olive between agroforestry systems, and monocrops and pure orchards. The Land Equivalent Ratio of yields and gross margins is always greater than 1 with cereals and legumes in agroforestry. Our results suggest that agroforestry systems are more productive, profitable and land-efficient than monocrops. Therefore, agroforestry may constitute a relevant strategy for a sustainable production. Nevertheless, additional experiments are needed to better understand the productivity of these systems and their advantages and limits.

This study aimed to measure the soil potential net N mineralization (PNM) and nitrification (PNN) down to 4 m depth and to discuss factors controlling their variability. Twenty-one soil cores were collected at the Restinclieres agroforestry experimental site, where 14-year-old hybrid walnut trees were intercropped with durum wheat. Soil cores were incubated in the dark in the laboratory at both 6 and 25 degrees C. The soil was a deep calcic fluvisol with a fluctuating water table. It featured a black layer that was very rich in organic matter and permanently water saturated at depths between 3.0 and 4.0 m. The mean soil mineral N content was 3 mg N kg(-1) soil in the upper 0.0-0.2 m layer, decreasing until a depth of 2 m and increasing to the maximum value of 25.8 mg N kg(-1) soil in the black layer. While nitrate (NO3-) was the dominant form of mineral N (89%) in the upper 0.0-0.2 m layer, its proportion progressively decreased with depth until ammonium (NH4+) became almost the only form of mineral N (97%) in the saturated black layer. Laboratory soil incubation revealed that PNM and PNN occurred at all depths, although the latter remained low at 6 degrees C. The soil nitrate content in the black layer was multiplied by 48 times after 51 days of incubation at 25 degrees C, whereas it was almost inexistent at the sampling date. While the soil total N, the pH and the incubation temperature explained 84% of the variation in PNM, only 29% of the percent nitrification variance was explained by the incubation temperature (T-inc) and the soil C-to-N ratio. These results point out the necessity to consider soil potential net N mineralization and nitrification of deep soil layers to improve model predictions.

In three consecutive years, 2012, 2013 and 2014, trees were subjected to two water regimes: Control (well-watered, WW), and 50% water deficit during one summer month, July (water-stressed, WS). In 2014, almost all 2013-shoots had a terminal inflorescence. They were separated into three length classes: short, 0.5-2 cm; medium, 2-11 cm; and long, equal or longer than 11 cm. Within each 2013-shoot size category, leaf number and leaf area of terminal inflorescences on these shoots were not affected significantly by the water regime. In the long shoot category, WW gave higher values for the bourse-shoot number in comparison to WS. The number of flowers per terminal inflorescence did not vary between WS and WW. To conclude, our results showed that the number of nodes of a shoot in 2013, and the number of leaves, leaf area and fruit-set of the inflorescence in 2014 as well as the frequency of bourse-overbourse between the couples of years 2012-13 and 2013-14 were not affected by moderate water stress. Overall, a 50% water stress over one month in summer for a late season cultivar did not decrease shoot growth in the same year, likely because shoot growth was already finished by summer months. Interestingly, it also did not affect inflorescence development, fruit-set and bourse-shoot formation in the following year. Working on a late cultivar, i.e. 'JoyaT', with a long period of fruit growth, likely buffers the effects of summer water deficit. Our study supported the idea that regulated deficit irrigation needs to be adapted to the conditions and the cultivar."

It was conducted in 2014 at Station Experimentale Fruits et Legumes (SUDEXPE-CEHM) in Southern France. The 'Joya (TM)' apple on Pajam-1 rootstock was used as the plant material. Trees were subjected to hand thinning to obtain four final crop load levels as high (100%; 10 fruit/cm(2) of branch cross-sectional area (BCSA)), medium-high (75%; 7.5 fruit/cm(2) of BCSA), medium-low (50%; 5 fruit/cm(2) of BCSA) and low (25%; 2.5 fruit/cm(2) of BCSA). The four crop load levels were set up in a randomized block design with four replications, and each plot was formed of five uniform trees. Stem water potential was weakly affected by crop load but was mainly driven by vapor pressure deficit. The maximum daily trunk diameter, by and large, reduced while crop load level increased. The increase in crop load level was negatively related to fruit size, acidity and soluble solids content. Crop load did not affect bitter pit incidence. However, in parallel to the increasing crop load level, cumulative yield, yield efficiency and water productivity increased."

It was carried out on a 9-year-old top worked apple cv. ""Joya (TM)"" on Pajam-1 rootstock. Water stress (at 50%) applied after vegetative growth was completed, from the beginning of July to the end of the irrigation season decreased size but increased soluble solids content in fruit. Water-stressed trees showed relatively high water use efficiency without causing a significant effect on yield. Indeed, the water amount used for one fruit was 11.41 (median) in water-stressed trees and 15.91 (median) in well-watered trees, although tree volume and leaf area were similar between the two water regimes. A within-tree network of dendrometers was installed in four locations (bottom of a branch and end of the same branch, fruit, and trunk). The branch and trunk's maximum and minimum diameter growth were observed in the morning and noon, respectively, over the diurnal period, whatever the water regime. The maximal diameter growth of fruit in both water regimes was during the afternoon on a diurnal basis, unlike vegetative tree portions."

New biologically-based fruit production strategies, i.e. taking into account tree growth and water status, are required to optimize irrigation and fertilization under abiotic stress conditions. It was hypothesized that a moderate abiotic stress, here deficit irrigation with or without nitrogen deficit, in the preharvest period, could decrease postharvest losses due to diseases and pruning weights due to reduced vegetative growth, without sacrificing the yield and fruit quality. This study was conducted over two years using the same trees of 'Moncante' nectarine cultivar grown in a commercial orchard. Trees were assigned to three treatments: (1) full irrigation at 80% estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc), (2) deficit irrigation, i.e. at 75% of full irrigation, and (3) deficit irrigation and deficit nitrogen, i.e. at 75% of full irrigation and 75% of usual N-fertilization adopted by the grower in this commercial orchard. Deficit irrigation alone and in combination with deficit nitrogen reduced postharvest diseases and pruning weights without significant yield losses. Our results suggest that ETc-based approaches of reduced water irrigation may be a sustainable way to decrease phytosanitary inputs and workload in the orchard while maintaining the orchard performance.

";10.1007/s10457-024-01092-6;;WOS:001342923700001;OCT 2024;;;;;;;;Agroforestry could be a major strategy to adapt agriculture to climate change, thanks to the microclimate effects of trees and improved infiltration. However, the experimental validation of these claims is scarce. In this methodological review, we discuss options for the experimental simulation of drought conditions in agroforestry field experiments, comparing it with strategies adopted in natural, agricultural, or forestry ecosystems. We classify rainout shelters used in field experiments according to mobility, completeness of rain interception and height of rainout shelter. We show that specificities of agroforestry systems create constraints and require compromises in the design and operation of rainout shelters. We conclude that large rainout shelters, which induce drought for both the trees and the crops while limiting artifacts and biases, would be most relevant for studying the resistance of agroforestry systems to drought. Unfortunately, the review of rainout shelters already used in agroforestry systems reveals a lack of rainout shelters capable of intercepting rain on both trees and crops, achieving total rain interception, while being relatively low-cost and manageable by a small team. Therefore, we benchmark three novel rainout shelter designs that we tested in a mature agroforestry system under Mediterranean climatic conditions. We discuss their advantages and disadvantages in terms of both scientific and operational aspects. While compromises had to be done between experimental design, risks of artifact/bias, effectiveness, ease of installation, operation and maintenance, and agricultural management, these prototypes are starting points for achieving well-performing rainout shelters and testing the effects of drought in agroforestry experiments.

Farmer Field Schools (FFS), an advisory service based on participatory principles, aim to support farmers' innovation. This study investigates farmers' innovation by characterizing their trajectories of change in agricultural practices after they participated in FFS. Two contrasting types of FFS for family farmers in the cotton-growing area of West Africa were selected. The FFS differed in how they were implemented; farmer participation was either consultative (farmers participated little in developing the FFS curricula and structure) or collaborative (farmers participated actively in developing the FFS curricula and structure). Former FFS participants were interviewed on their successive changes in cropping practices over a 4 to 8-year time span. The sample included seven FFS on rainy season cropping (17 interviews in Burkina Faso, 22 in Togo), and four vegetable gardening FFS (21 interviews in Togo). The Efficiency-Substitution-Redesign framework was applied to pest management, organic and mineral fertilization and legume cropping practices. Our results show that the way FFS were implemented influenced farmers' trajectories of change in practices. After consultative FFS, changes in practices were limited. After collaborative FFS, we found a variety of changes in the production and use of compost, biopesticides, and inclusion of legumes in the cropping system through intercropping or pure cropping. Redesign of cropping systems included increasing on-farm compost production, collective pest management, and crop rotations. Collaborative FFS can be seen as step-by-step design processes for locally adapted cropping systems. This is the first time that farmers' trajectories of change in practices are used to assess the effects of FFS. This approach is valuable for understanding farmers' decision making and the role of participatory innovation support initiatives such as FFS."

";10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135423;135423;WOS:000905075600001;DEC 2022;;;;;;;;Following the Paris agreement in 2015, the European Union (EU) set a carbon neutrality objective by 2050, and so did France. The French agricultural sector can contribute as a carbon sink through carbon storage in biomass and soil, in addition to reducing GHG emissions. The objective of this study is to quantitatively assess the additional storage potential and cost of a set of eight carbon-storing practices. The impacts of these agricultural practices on soil organic carbon storage and crop production are assessed at a very fine spatial scale, using crop and grassland models. The associated area base, GHG budget, and implementation costs are assessed and aggregated at the region level. The economic model BANCO uses this information to derive the marginal abatement cost curve for France and identify the combination of carbon storing practices that minimizes the total cost of achieving a given national net GHG mitigation target. We find that a substantial amount of carbon, 36.2 to 52.9 MtCO(2)e yr(-1), can be stored in soil and biomass for reasonable carbon prices of 55 and 250 (sic) tCO(2)e(-1), respectively (corresponding to current and 2030 French carbon value for climate action), mainly by developing agroforestry and hedges, generalising cover crops, and introducing or extending temporary grasslands in crop sequences. This finding questions the 3-5 times lower target of 10 MtCO(2)e.yr(-1) retained for the agricultural carbon sink by the French climate neutrality strategy. Overall, this would decrease total French GHG emissions by 9.2-13.8%, respectively (reference year 2019).

Agroforestry systems could bring solutions to these environmental degradations. A simulation model able to represent the growth and interactions between olive trees and annual crops would be useful to rapidly test and evaluate innovative olive-based agroforestry systems without the need for space and time-consuming field experiments. The Hi-sAFe model simulates agroforestry systems in three dimensions according to interactions between forest trees and annual crops for water, nitrogen and light. However, this model was developed and parameterised only for forest trees and not for fruit trees whose balance between the vegetative and the fruit organs is crucial. Two main adaptations were made to the model to simulate olive-based agroforestry systems: the addition of a fruit-setting module and the carbon allocation module adaptation. Here, we present the experimental estimation of two important parameters of these modules, both at tree scale: the maximum number of fruits m-2 leaf area and the maximum daily carbon allocation to fruits. The maximum fruit load per olive trees was estimated at 1356 fruits per m(2) leaf area using three genotypes of an ' Arbequina' x 'Oliviere' progeny. To determine the maximum daily carbon allocation to fruits, we hypothesized a cultivar effect. For these reason, nine olive trees, of three cultivars ('Leccino', 'Cypressino' and 'Manzanille'), with a low fruit load were selected from the three cultivars, and samples of fruits were dry-weighted every week for 12 weeks during fruit growth. The maximum daily carbon allocation to fruits (g carbon olive(-1) day(-1)) varied significantly between 'Leccino' and 'Cypressino' (3.9x10(-3) and 4.3x10(-3), respectively) and 'Manzanille' (7.3x10(-3)). The value of these two parameters not identifiable in the literature can be set to 1356 fruits m(-2) of leaf area (maximum number of fruits m-2 leaf area) and at 7.3x10(-3) g carbon olive(-1) day(-1) (maximum daily carbon allocation to fruits).

Virtual experiments with models would allow the performance and sustainability of these systems to be evaluated in a range of pedoclimatic and management scenarios, taking into account the interactions of fruit trees with crops. The models should represent tree and crop growth in 3D, run simulations over the whole life cycle of the orchard, and account for management practices that influence tree-crop interactions. We reviewed existing fruit tree and agroforestry models and have proposed a decision tree to guide future modellers in choosing a model that meets their simulation objectives. None of the reviewed models met all requirements, but we identified improvements that could be made to two existing models to accurately simulate temperate fruit tree based agroforestry systems.

We compared the dehydration dynamics of leaf meristems, which are the key surviving organs, plant mortality, and recovery of Mediterranean and temperate populations of two perennial grass species, Dactylis glomerata and Festuca arundinacea, grown in monocultures and mixtures under a low-VPD (1.5 kPa) versus a high-VPD drought (2.2 kPa). The lethal drought index (LD50), that is, SWC associated with 50% plant mortality, ranged from 2.87% (psi s = -1.68 MPa) to 2.19% (psi s = -4.47 MPa) and reached the lowest values under the low-VPD drought. Populations of D. glomerata were more dehydration-tolerant (lower LD50), survived and recovered better than F. arundinacea populations. Plant-plant interactions modified dehydration tolerance and improved post-drought recovery in mixtures compared with monocultures. Water content as low as 20.7%-36.1% in leaf meristems allowed 50% of plants to survive. We conclude that meristem dehydration causes plant mortality and that drought acclimation can increase dehydration tolerance. Genetic diversity, acclimation and plant-plant interactions are essential sources of dehydration tolerance variability to consider when predicting drought-induced mortality.

This study assesses and compares the climate change awareness level of Mediterranean university students in France and Greece. Emphasis was given to three research questions regarding knowledge, information sources, and awareness level. A questionnaire was used to determine the knowledge level and awareness of 641 university students in France and Greece. Principal Component Analysis was used to determine the main factors influencing the above-mentioned aspects, as was an independent sample t-test to compare the sample's awareness level and socio-economic characteristics. Based on a modified climate change awareness index developed by the researchers, most students were found to have a low level of awareness of climate change. However, there is evidence that students are willing to undertake specific eco-friendly initiatives. Additionally, one of the study's key findings is that students' knowledge and awareness of climate change varies according to socio-demographic characteristics such as gender, age, income level, and academic field.

The method was performed over a study site located near Orleans city of north-central France for four years (2017 until 2020). First, training data of irrigated and non-irrigated plots were selected using predefined selection criteria to obtain sufficient samples of irrigated and non-irrigated plots each year. The training data selection criteria is based on two irrigation metrics; the first one is a SAR-based metric derived from the S1 time series and the second is an optical-based metric derived from the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) time series of the S2 data. Using the newly developed irrigation event detection model (IEDM) applied for all S1 time series in VV (Vertical-Vertical) and VH (Vertical-Horizontal) polarizations, an irrigation weight metric was calculated for each plot. Using the NDVI time series, the maximum NDVI value achieved in the crop cycle was considered as a second selection metric. By fixing threshold values for both metrics, a dataset of irrigated and non-irrigated samples was constructed each year. Later, a random forest classifier (RF) was built for each year in order to map the summer agricultural plots into irrigated/non-irrigated. The irrigation classification model uses the S1 and NDVI time series calculated over the selected training plots. Finally, the proposed irrigation classifier was validated using real in situ data collected each year. The results show that, using the proposed classification procedure, the overall accuracy for the irrigation classification reaches 84.3%, 93.0%, 81.8%, and 72.8% for the years 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The comparison between our proposed classification approach and the RF classifier built directly from in situ data showed that our approach reaches an accuracy nearly similar to that obtained using in situ RF classifiers with a difference in overall accuracy not exceeding 6.2%. The analysis of the obtained classification accuracies of the proposed method with precipitation data revealed that years with higher rainfall amounts during the summer crop-growing season (irrigation period) had lower overall accuracy (72.8% for 2017) whereas years encountering a drier summer had very good accuracy (93.0% for 2019)."

In this study, both products were first evaluated using in situ measurements obtained by the calibrated time delay reflectometer in field campaigns. The accuracy against the in situ measurements was defined by the correlation coefficient R, the root mean square difference (RMSD), and the bias and the unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD). Then, the soil moisture estimations from both SSM products were intercompared over one year (October 2016-October 2017). Both products show generally good agreement with in situ measurements. The results show that using in situ measurements collected over agricultural areas and grasslands, the accuracy of the C-SSM is good (RMSD = 6.0 vol%, ubRMSD = 6.0 vol%, and R = 0.48) but less accurate than the (SMP)-M-2 (RMSD = 4.0 vol%, ubRMSD = 3.9 vol%, and R = 0.77). The intercomparison between the two SSM products over one year shows that both products are highly correlated over agricultural areas that are mainly used for cereals (R value between 0.5 and 0.9 and RMSE between 4 and 6 vol%). Over areas containing forests and vineyards, the C-SSM values tend to overestimate the (SMP)-M-2 values (bias > 5 vol%). In the case of well-developed vegetation cover, the (SMP)-M-2 does not provide SSM estimations while C-SSM sometimes provides underestimated SSM values.

First, the temporal behavior of the SAR backscattering coefficient over 832 plots containing different crop types was analyzed. Through this analysis, the rice cultivation was identified using metrics derived from the Gaussian profile of the VV/VH time series (3 metrics), the variance of the VV/VH time series (one metric), and the slope of the linear regression of the VH time series (one metric). Using the derived metrics, rice plots were mapped through two different approaches: decision tree and Random Forest (RF). To validate the accuracy of each approach, the classified rice map was compared to the available national data. Similar high overall accuracy was obtained using both approaches. The overall accuracy obtained using a simple decision tree reached 96.3%, whereas an overall accuracy of 96.6% was obtained using the RF classifier. The approach, therefore, provides a simple yet precise and powerful tool to map paddy rice areas.

In the context of water management, the aim of this study is to monitor irrigation activities by detecting the irrigation episodes at plot scale using the Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) time series over intensively irrigated grassland plots located in the Crau plain of southeast France. The method consisted of assessing the newly developed irrigation detection model (IDM) at plot scale over the irrigated grassland plots. First, four S1-SAR time series acquired from four different S1-SAR acquisitions (different S1 orbits), each at six-day revisit time, were obtained over the study site. Next, the IDM was applied at each available SAR image from each S1-SAR series to obtain an irrigation indicator at each SAR image (no, low, medium, or high irrigation possibility). Then, the irrigation indicators obtained at each image from each S1-SAR time series (four series) were added and combined by threshold value criteria to determine the existence or absence of an irrigation event. Finally, the performance of the IDM for irrigation detection was assessed by comparing the in situ recorded irrigation events at each plot and the detected irrigation events. The results show that using only the VV polarization, 82.4% of the in situ registered irrigation events are correctly detected with an F_score value reaching 73.8%. Less accuracy is obtained using only the VH polarization, where 79.9% of the in situ irrigation events are correctly detected with an F_score of 72.2%. The combined use of the VV and VH polarization showed that 74.1% of the irrigation events are detected with a higher F_score value of 76.4%. The analysis of the undetected irrigation events revealed that, in the presence of very well-developed vegetation cover (normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) >= 0.8); higher uncertainty in irrigation detection is observed, where 80% of the undetected events correspond to an NDVI value greater than 0.8. The results also showed that small-sized plots encounter more false irrigation detections than large-sized plots certainly because the pixel spacing of S1 data (10 m x 10 m) is not adapted to small size plots. The obtained results prove the efficiency of the S1 C-band data and the IDM for detecting irrigation events at the plot scale, which would help in improving the irrigation water management at large scales especially with availability and global coverage of the S1 product."

The proposed approach is a decision tree-based method relying on the change detection in the S1 backscattering coefficients at plot scale. First, the behavior of the S1 backscattering coefficients following irrigation events has been analyzed at plot scale over three study sites located in Montpellier (southeast France), Tarbes (southwest France), and Catalonia (northeast Spain). To eliminate the uncertainty between rainfall and irrigation, the S1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal and the soil moisture estimations at grid scale (10 km x 10 km) have been used. Then, a tree-like approach has been constructed to detect irrigation events at each S1 date considering additional filters to reduce ambiguities due to vegetation development linked to the growth cycle of different crops types as well as the soil surface roughness. To enhance the detection of irrigation events, a filter using the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Sentinel-2 optical images has been proposed. Over the three study sites, the proposed method was applied on all possible S1 acquisitions in ascending and descending modes. The results show that 84.8% of the irrigation events occurring over agricultural plots in Montpellier have been correctly detected using the proposed method. Over the Catalonian site, the use of the ascending and descending SAR acquisition modes shows that 90.2% of the non-irrigated plots encountered no detected irrigation events whereas 72.4% of the irrigated plots had one and more detected irrigation events. Results over Catalonia also show that the proposed method allows the discrimination between irrigated and non-irrigated plots with an overall accuracy of 85.9%. In Tarbes, the analysis shows that irrigation events could still be detected even in the presence of abundant rainfall events during the summer season where two and more irrigation events have been detected for 90% of the irrigated plots. The novelty of the proposed method resides in building an effective unsupervised tool for near real-time detection of irrigation events at plot scale independent of the studied geographical context.

Today, the free and open access Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data with high revisit time offers a powerful tool for irrigation mapping at plot scale. Up to date, few studies have used S1 and S2 data to provide approaches for mapping irrigated plots. This study proposes a method to map irrigated plots using S1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) time series. First, a dense temporal series of S1 backscattering coefficients were obtained at plot scale in VV (Vertical-Vertical) and VH (Vertical-Horizontal) polarizations over a study site located in Catalonia, Spain. In order to remove the ambiguity between rainfall and irrigation events, the S1 signal obtained at plot scale was used conjointly to S1 signal obtained at a grid scale (10 km x 10 km). Later, two mathematical transformations, including the principal component analysis (PCA) and the wavelet transformation (WT), were applied to the several SAR temporal series obtained in both VV and VH polarization. Irrigated areas were then classified using the principal component (PC) dimensions and the WT coefficients in two different random forest (RF) classifiers. Another classification approach using one dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was also performed on the obtained S1 temporal series. The results derived from the RF classifiers with S1 data show high overall accuracy using the PC values (90.7%) and the WT coefficients (89.1%). By applying the CNN approach on SAR data, a significant overall accuracy of 94.1% was obtained. The potential of optical images to map irrigated areas by the mean of a normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) temporal series was also tested in this study in both the RF and the CNN approaches. The overall accuracy obtained using the NDVI in RF classifier reached 89.5% while that in the CNN reached 91.6%. The combined use of optical and radar data slightly enhanced the classification in the RF classifier but did not significantly change the accuracy obtained in the CNN approach using S1 data.

Based on the efficiency frontier concept and the decomposition of resource use efficiency, we used a three-quadrant framework allowing to carry a functional analysis of the cropping system. Using a data envelope approach, we established boundary curves which represent the maximum achievable performances (yield, N uptake) when N is the only limiting factor. This framework has been first implemented and tested using published data from 112 agronomic situations of rainfed durum wheat in experimental fields in northern Syria and then further applied on a data set of 245 agronomic situations of durum wheat in farmers' fields in two grain-producing regions of Tunisia. The results demonstrated the impact of preceding crops: durum wheat following legumes or vegetable showed a higher potential for N uptake but with only a minor effect on its conversion into grains. This positive effect of diversified rotation on potential N uptake by durum wheat is partly of-set by increased N uptake gaps in farmer's fields indicating a higher effect of other limiting factors.

However, the belowground microbes associated with crops below trees remain seldom addressed. This study aimed at elucidating the effects of olive AF system intercropped with durum wheat (Dw), barely (Ba), chickpea (Cp), or faba bean (Fb) on crops biomass and their soil-rhizosphere microbial networks as compared to conventional full sun cropping (SC) under rainfed conditions. To test the hypothesis, we compared the prokaryotic and the fungal communities inhabiting the rhizosphere of two cereals and legumes grown either in AF or SC. We determined the most suitable annual crop species in AF under low-rainfed conditions. Moreover, to deepen our understanding of the rhizosphere network dynamics of annual crops under AF and SC systems, we characterized the microbial hubs that are most likely responsible for modifying the microbial community structure and the variability of crop biomass of each species. Herein, we found that cereals produced significantly more above-ground biomass than legumes following in descending order: Ba > Dw > Cp > Fb, suggesting that crop species play a significant role in improving soil water use and that cereals are well-suited to rainfed conditions within both types of agrosystems. The type of agrosystem shapes crop microbiomes with the only marginal influence of host selection. However, more relevant was to unveil those crops recruits specific bacterial and fungal taxa from the olive-belowground communities. Of the selected soil physicochemical properties, organic matter was the principal driver in shaping the soil microbial structure in the AF system. The co-occurrence network analyses indicated that the AF system generates higher ecological stability than the SC system under stressful climate conditions. Furthermore, legumes' rhizosphere microbiome possessed a higher resilient capacity than cereals. We also identified different fungal keystones involved in litter decomposition and drought tolerance within AF systems facing the water-scarce condition and promoting crop production within the SC system. Overall, we showed that AF reduces cereal and legume rhizosphere microbial diversity, enhances network complexity, and leads to more stable beneficial microbial communities, especially in severe drought, thus providing more accurate predictions to preserve soil diversity under unfavorable environmental conditions.

Alley cropping is an agroforestry practice that represents a promising adaptation strategy to sustain yield productivity under drier conditions. However, the presence of trees limits the productivity of the intercrop by reducing light availability and by competing for soil water resources, which could potentially exacerbate the yield losses due to drought conditions. Furthermore, the effects of co-occurring drought and shade stresses on annual crops are still poorly understood. To tackle this issue, we performed a rainfall manipulation experiment on winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown in full-sun conditions (agricultural control) and under different levels of shade in a 25-year walnut-based alley cropping system located in southern France. We evaluated first the effect of trees on light and water availability, and we then studied the effects of early drought (135 mm excluded from April to the end of May) and light conditions on crop performances and yield components. At 3.5 m from the tree line, light availability was reduced on average by 19% at south and 35% at north of trees over the entire crop cycle and mostly after tree budburst. The impact of trees on soil water content in the crop root zone was weak thanks to the good complementarity of the respective root systems. Under normal rainfall conditions, tree shade decreased pea yield from -25% to -77% compared to full-sun conditions. In case of spring drought, pea yield was decreased by -22% in full-sun conditions. The negative effect of tree shade was reduced and decreased pea yield only by -1% to -47%. Under the most intense shade conditions, pea yield was even higher under drought than in normal rainfall conditions. The analysis of crop dynamics and yield components revealed that the vegetative development of pea ceased under drought to the benefit of biomass allocation towards the reproductive organs. Pea yield was less impacted by tree shade under spring drought because yield elaboration relied less on the success of pod set, sensitive to shade and, more on grain filling, improved in case of early drought event. This study supports the hypothesis that agroforestry systems may be more resilient in the case of early drought.

(BMC Ecol Evol 21:1-193, 2021) assessed the effects of European agroforestry systems on biodiversity, estimated by species richness or species diversity. They showed that the effects of silvoarable and silvopastoral systems depend on the systems they are compared to and the taxa studied. Further, they found that only silvoarable systems increased species richness or diversity, compared to cropland. The authors conclude that agroforestry systems have weak effects on biodiversity and that landscape context or land-use history are probably more important than the practice of agroforestry in itself. However, we draw attention to important shortcomings in this meta-analysis, which downplay the potential of agroforestry for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. We hope that the meta-analysis by Mupepele et al. (BMC Ecol Evol 21:1-193, 2021), and our comments, will contribute to improving the quality of research on agroforestry systems and biodiversity conservation.

In such agroforestry systems, non-crop herbaceous vegetation develops on the tree rows, resulting in understory vegetation strips (UVS). UVS are perceived both as reservoirs for weeds and opportunities for biodiversity conservation. The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of UVS to (i) plant spillover and (ii) plant diversity conservation, depending on their functional structure and the farming system. Vegetation surveys were carried out in May 2017 in South-Western France over 16 winter cereal fields (8 alley cropping agroforestry systems and 8 pure crop controls), half under conventional farming and half under organic farming. Using data on plant functional traits related to dispersal strategies and response to agricultural disturbances, we explained the mechanisms involved in plant spillover between habitats. The study revealed that very few species were able to disperse far into crop alleys, except perennial species producing rhizomes and stolons whose spread has been favored by tillage. The presence of UVS in agroforestry fields did not increase weed-crop ratio (i.e. weed coverage / weed and crop coverage) in adjacent crop alleys. On the other hand, UVS harbored richer and more abundant floras (with high proportions of species rarely found in arable habitats) compared to crop alleys and pure crop controls, especially under conventional farming. The functional approach provided insights for weed management in alley cropping agroforestry systems in order to optimize plant diversity conservation without increasing weed-crop ratio. This study showed the relevance of using the functional approach to understand the mechanisms behind plant spillover in cropping systems that integrate semi-natural habitats.

Agroecological infrastructures (AEI) are devoted to the support of ecosystem service providers, although they have mixed effects on natural enemies of crop pests. In temperate regions, alley cropping agroforestry involves within-field AEI, in the form of tree rows and associated understory vegetation strips. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of generalist predators (carabid beetles and cursorial spiders) to control weed seeds and invertebrate pests in alley cropping vs pure crop systems, under two contrasting farming systems (conventional vs organic). Predator surveys were carried out in May and June 2017 in South-Western France over 12 winter cereal fields. Our study revealed that the effect of alley cropping was modulated by the farming system. Under conventional farming, alley cropping had a negative effect on the activity-density and species richness of generalist predators, especially regarding carnivorous carabids whose activity-density was reduced by nearly 50%. Under organic farming, alley cropping enhanced both the activity-density and complementarity of generalist predators, with a two-fold increase in the activity-density of seed-feeding carabids (predominantly granivorous and omnivorous), potentially promoting weed seed and invertebrate pest control. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of AEI in promoting natural enemies depends on the farming system at the field scale, which affects resource availability and determines spillover intensity between habitats. AEI are often perceived as sources of natural enemies. However, sink and retention effects (i.e. reduced or delayed spillover into crop fields due to higher attractiveness of AEI) should not be overlooked as they can explain the mixed impacts of AEI on natural enemy communities.

Alley cropping agroforestry is a land use practice in which arable crops are grown between tree rows. In such systems, understory vegetation strips (UVS) develop in the tree rows, providing habitats undisturbed by soil tillage. We investigated whether UVS are major overwintering habitats for invertebrates. We focused on carabid communities, which are dominant beneficial invertebrates in crop fields, but suffer from agricultural intensification. We described carabid communities with functional traits related to sensitivity to agricultural disturbances and ecological functions (i.e. pest control). Sampling of invertebrates were carried out from February to June 2018 over seven agroforestry fields in Restinclieres Estate (South France), one of the oldest experimental sites in Europe. The study revealed that 55% of invertebrate taxonomic groups were more abundant in UVS, whereas only 14% were more abundant in crop alleys. Crop pests were overwintering mainly in crop alleys while beneficial invertebrates were more dependent on UVS. Finally, UVS hosted carabids sensitive to agricultural disturbances, characterized by large body length, predominantly granivorous diet and overwintering in adult stage. On the other hand, crop alleys were home to smaller carnivorous species overwintering in both larval and adult stages, which can tolerate high levels of disturbance. Environmental and agricultural policies should consider agroforestry systems, especially understory vegetation strips, as valuable habitats for biodiversity conservation and biological control in agricultural landscapes.

Methods In 16 Mediterranean vineyards representing both a pedoclimate and a soil management gradient, we measured the mass loss of green above-ground biomass of 50 weed communities during decomposition in standard conditions and key leaf traits of dominant species [e.g. leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf lignin to nitrogen ratio (lignin:N)]. Both the mean [i.e. community-weighted mean (CWM)] and diversity (i.e. Rao index) were computed at the community level. Path analysis was used to quantify the effects of agro-environmental filters on the mass loss of weed communities through their functional properties. Key Results Tillage and mowing filtered more decomposable communities than chemical weeding (16 and 8 % of higher mass loss after 2 months of decomposition). Path analysis selected weed management practice type as the main factor determining mass loss through its effect on functional properties, while soil and climate had minor and no effects, respectively. Chemical weeding favoured communities with higher investment in resistant leaves (e.g. 38 % higher lignin:N, 22 % lower leaf nitrogen content) which resulted in lower mass loss compared with tilled and mowed communities. Mowing favoured communities with 47 % higher biomass and with 46 % higher nitrogen content. Conclusions Weed management significantly influenced weed mass loss, while the pedoclimate had little effect. Our results suggest that mowing is a promising alternative to herbicide use, favouring higher biomass, nitrogen content and decomposability potential of weeds.

Complementary to taxonomic studies, trait-based approaches are promising ways for a better understanding of weed community responses to environmental and agronomic filters. In the present study, the impacts of climate, soil characteristics, seasons and weed management practices (chemical weeding, tillage and mowing) were assessed on weed communities from 46 plots in three French wine growing regions (Champagne, Languedoc and Rho<SIC>ne valley). These agro-environmental gradients structuring weed communities according to their combinations of traits were highlighted using multivariate analysis (RLQ). The impacts of these filters on Community Weighted Means (CWM) and Community Weighted Variance (CWV) of weed communities were analysed using mixed and null modelling. Our results showed that spatio-temporal and weed management practice variables explained from 13% to 48% of the total variance of CWM (specific leaf area, maximum height, seed mass, flowering onset and duration and lateral spread). Region, seasonality and management practices explained 53%, 28% and 19% of CWM marginal variance, respectively. Weed management impacted CWM and CWV through two main gradients: (i) a soil disturbance gradient with high mechanical disturbance of soil in tilled plots and low mechanical disturbance in chemically weeded plots and (ii) a vegetation cover gradient with high vegetation abundance in mowed plots compared to barer soils in tilled and chemically weeded plots. In Languedoc, chemical weeding filtered weed communities with ruderal strategy trait values (low seed mass, small-stature) while mowed communities were more competitive (higher seed mass, higher stature and lower SLA). In Languedoc and Champagne, tillage favoured communities with high seed mass that increases the viability of buried seeds and high lateral spread values associated to the ability to resprout after tillage. This study demonstrated that trait-based approaches can be successfully applied to perennial cropping systems such as vineyards, in order to understand community assembly to better guide weed management practices.

Understanding how plant communities are shifting in response to land management and climate changes is necessary to predict future ecosystem functioning and improve the resilience of managed ecosystems, such as agroecosystems. Using Mediterranean weed communities as models of managed plant communities in a climate change hotspot, we quantified the extent to which they have shifted from the 1980s to the 2020s in response to climate and management changes in vineyards. The weed communities of the same 40 vineyards in the Montpellier region were surveyed using the same protocol in spring, summer, and autumn, for two years, with a 40-year interval (1978-1979 vs. 2020-2021). In four decades, the annual range of temperatures (i.e., the difference between the warmest month's and the coldest month's mean temperatures) increased by 1.2 degrees C and the summer temperatures by 2 degrees C. Weed management diversified over time with the adoption of mowing that replaced the chemical weeding of interrows. Chemical weeding is now mostly limited to the area under the row. Current weed communities were 41% more abundant, 24% more diverse, and with a less even distribution of abundance across species than the 1980s communities at the vineyard level. Modern communities were composed of more annual species (57% of annual species in the 1980s vs. 80% in the 2020s) with lower community-weighted seed mass and were composed of fewer C4 species. They had higher community-weighted specific leaf area, higher leaf dry matter content, and lower leaf area than the 1980s weed communities. At the community level, the onset of flowering was earlier and the duration of flowering was longer in the 2020s. Climate change induced more stress-tolerant communities in the 2020s while the diversification of weed management practices favored less ruderal communities. This study shows that plant communities are shifting in response to climate change and that land management is a strong lever for action to model more diverse and eventually more desirable weed communities in the future.

";10.1093/aob/mcaa089;;WOS:000591847300017;;;745-763;;;;;;Background and Aims Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is the fifth most widely produced fruit in the world. Its cultivation, mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, raises a number of issues such as the irregular fruit production across years, phenological asynchronisms that lead to long periods of pest and disease susceptibility, and the heterogeneity of fruit quality and maturity at harvest. To address these issues, we developed an integrative functional-structural plant model that synthesizes knowledge about the vegetative and reproductive development of the mango tree and opens up the possible simulation of cultivation practices. Methods We designed a model of architectural development in order to precisely characterize the intricate developmental processes of the mango tree. The appearance of botanical entities was decomposed into elementary stochastic events describing occurrence, intensity and liming of development. These events were determined by structural (position and fate of botanical entities) and temporal (appearance dates) factors. Daily growth and development of growth units and inflorescences were modelled using empirical distributions and thermal time. Fruit growth was determined using an ecophysiological model that simulated carbon- and water-related processes at the fruiting branch scale. Key Results The model simulates the dynamics of the population of growth units, inflorescences and fruits at the tree scale during a growing cycle. Modelling the effects of structural and temporal factors makes it possible to simulate satisfactorily the complex interplays between vegetative and reproductive development. The model allowed the characterization of the susceptibility of mango tree to pests and the investigatation of the influence of tree architecture on fruit growth. Conclusions This integrative functional-structural model simulates mango tree vegetative and reproductive development over successive growing cycles, allowing a precise characterization of tree phenology and fruit growth and production. The next step is to integrate the effects of cultivation practices, such as pruning, into the model.

It aims at determining the diversity of species and the tree size structure in these parklands, as well as at identifying the threats to their sustainability, in order to assist decision making on natural resource conservation. To this end, 45 plots of 50x50m size were inventoried. In each plot, an exhaustive inventory of trees was performed, including species identification, height measurement and estimates of regeneration and mortality rates. Additionally, 116 stakeholders were interviewed about their management practices, the revenue they obtained from agroforestry parklands, and their opinion on the future of these parks. A total of 2739 Elaeis guineensis palm trees and 3948 trees from other species were observed in the 11.25ha studied. Hence a relative density of 40.96 individuals of E. guineensis ha(-1). The 63 species belonged to 51 genus within 23 botanical families. The analysis of tree communities indicated a strong role of human management on the species composition of parklands, with cultural value trees near the villages and wood production trees further away, and with some sites having more trees with medicinal uses. The distribution of tree sizes of E. guineensis and estimates of mortality and regeneration rates indicated that the population of palm trees is ageing and regeneration is too low to compensate mortality. Based on interviews, palm production is decreasing in the area, and causes of decline identified by the farmers were salinization, drought, illegal cutting, and bush fires, i.e., both natural and anthropogenic causes. In view of the importance of these parklands for the local economy and food security, better management of E. guineensis parklands is required to ensure their sustainability.

Our study focused on mango (Mangifera indica L.) for which it has been shown that reproduction decreases and delays vegetative bud outgrowth. This, in turn, affects flowering and fruiting in the following cycle. Vegetative growth therefore plays a pivotal role in irregular fruit production patterns across consecutive years. Our aim was to decipher the respective roles of hormones and carbohydrates on the negative effects of reproduction on vegetative growth. We analyzed the changes in various hormone (auxin, cytokinin, abscisic acid) and carbohydrate (glucose, sucrose, starch) concentrations in terminal axes with vegetative and reproductive fates of two mango cultivars, Cogshall and Jose, characterized by different bearing patterns, across consecutive phenological periods during a growing cycle. Auxin concentrations were high in inflorescences, fruit peduncles and axes bearing inflorescences or fruit, suggesting auxin-induced inhibition of vegetative bud outgrowth in the flowering and fruiting axes. Moreover, growing fruits, which are strong sink organs, depleted carbohydrates from non-fruiting axes. During vegetative growth, this starch depletion probably contributed to decreasing the probability of and to delaying vegetative bud outgrowth of reproductive axes for Cogshall, and of reproductive and nonreproductive axes for Jose. Starch dynamics in quiescent and flowering growth units during early fruit growth and their starch concentrations at fruit maturity differed between the two cultivars, presumably in relation to the observed contrasted crop loads and/or to differences in photosynthetic capacity or carbohydrate allocation. These differences between the two cultivars in terms of starch concentration in terminal axes during vegetative growth could partly explain their different bearing patterns.

Understanding the role of phenotypic plasticity in plant adaptation to these changing conditions is crucial. This research focuses on Bromopsis erecta, a dominant perennial grass in European and Mediterranean grasslands, to predict its potential adaptation to climate change. We assessed plants from shallow and deep soils (i.e., with contrasting water reserves) of a Mediterranean rangeland in southern France, and tested the effect of six years of experimentally increased summer drought compared to the ambient conditions on plant traits, survival and abundance. In both field and common garden experiments, we measured water-related traits, including static traits under non-limiting water conditions, and dynamic traits, such as rates of trait variation during drought. Trait plasticity was determined as a reaction norm to increasing soil water stress and was tested against changes in B. erecta abundance over the past decade, including the study period. Trait plasticity was detected only for leaf dry matter content (LDMC), revealing that the resource strategy of B. erecta became more conservative over less than a decade with higher LDMC and leaf thickness according to the plant economic spectrum. No plasticity was found for osmotic potential or specific leaf area. The variability of other traits was ascribed to the possible lagging effect of previous water stress and was associated more with soil depth than with previous summer drought intensity. The abundance decline of B. erecta, which dropped from 20 % to around 5 % in shallow soils, was not associated with the plasticity of LDMC but was positively correlated with variations in leaf base membrane damage, meaning unexpectedly, that plants exposed to the most severe summer drought also had the most sensitive leaf base membranes, a possible sign of maladaptive trait plasticity in the population. This key trait response reveals boundaries to the adaptive capacity of this perennial grass to survive pluri-annual drought.

The mechanisms underlying the response of herbaceous communities to such drier environments should be investigated to identify the resilience thresholds of Mediterranean rangelands. A 5-year experiment was conducted in deep and shallow soil rangelands of southern France. A rainout shelter for 75 days in summer imposed drier and warmer conditions. Total soil water content was measured monthly to model available daily soil water. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP), forage quality, and the proportion of graminoids in ANPP were measured in spring and autumn. Plant senescence and plant cover were assessed in summer and spring, respectively. The experimental years were among the driest ever recorded at the site. Therefore, manipulated summer droughts were drier than long-term ambient conditions. Interactions between treatment, community type, and experimental year were found for most variables. In shallow soil communities, spring plant cover decreased markedly with time. This legacy effect, driven by summer plant mortality and the loss of perennial graminoids, led to an abrupt loss of resilience when the extreme water stress index exceeded 37 mm 10 day-1, characterized by a reduction of spring plant cover below 50% and a decreased ANPP in rainy years. Conversely, the ANPP of deep soil communities remained unaffected by increased summer drought, although the presence of graminoids increased and forage nutritive value decreased. This study highlights the role of the soil water reserve of Mediterranean plant communities in modulating ecosystem responses to chronically intensified summer drought. Communities on deep soils were resilient, but communities on shallow soils showed a progressive, rapid, and intense degradation associated with a loss of resilience capacity. Notably, indexes of extreme stress were a better indicator of tipping points than indexes of integrated annual stress. Considering the role of soil water availability in other herbaceous ecosystems should improve the ability to predict the resilience of plant communities under climate change.

This transition often requires making the agrosystem more complex and increasing the number of crops to increase biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper introduces a flexible model based on Constraint Programming (CP) to address the crop allocation problem. This problem takes a cropping calendar as input and aims at allocating crops to respect several constraints. We have shown that it is possible to model both agroecological and operational constraints at the level of a small farm. Experiments on an organic microfarm have shown that it is possible to combine these constraints to design very different cropping scenarios and that our approach can apply to real situations. Our promising results in this case study also demonstrate the potential of AI-based tools to address small farmers' challenges in the context of the sustainable agriculture transition.

The understanding of the physiological processes that occur in the peach tree during the dormancy period in mild winter regions (MWR) is important for the selection of new cultivars more adapted to these regions. The aim of this study was to bring more elements to build mechanistic understanding of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) mobilization in one-year shoots of two low winter chilling peach cultivars, 'T. Beauty' and 'S. aurea', during the dormancy period and the resumption of growth in MWR and their interactions with blooming and leafing. It is hypothesized that these low chilling peach cultivars do not enter into deep endodormancy and are, therefore, able to respond to external cues of growth and development. Our results showed that the amount of starch reserve, the mobilization and the use of NSC by buds are not limiting for low chilling cultivars during dormancy period in mild winter regions.

It is required to identify the main drivers of infestation for multiple pests at different scales. In particular, large scale approaches are missing, while they could contribute to increase the predictability of pest infestation. In this study, the French national Epiphyt dataset (part of the national epidemiological monitoring service) was used to assess the relative importance of weather and landscape drivers on the between-region variability in the level of occurrence of some agricultural pests. Using a regional resolution, we analysed the proportion of occurrence of slugs, cereal aphids and oilseed rape pests over 181 small agricultural areas ('regions') across France in 2018. The mean proportion of occurrence per region was 0.17 for slugs, 0.25 for cereal aphids and 0.61 for oilseed rape pests. Weather variables were more explanatory than landscape ones for the proportion of occurrence of slugs and oilseed rape pests while the two types of variables had a similar level of explanation for the regional proportion of aphid occurrence. Slugs were favoured by high winter temperatures, high soil wetness index and important proportions of hedgerows in the region but negatively influenced by high winter rainfalls. Cereal aphids and oilseed rape pests were negatively influenced by the regional proportion of grassland. Additionally, the winter air humidity and the proportion of perennial crops in the region decreased the proportion of occurrence of oilseed rape pests. We detected no effect of the proportion of host crop or the proportion of organic farming in the region. This study emphasises that, in line with findings derived from more local studies, weather characteristics are an important driver of the regional level of pest occurrence in arable fields; it also highlights that the proportion of grassland at the regional scale could be a key tool to design insect-pest suppressive landscapes."

Ecological theory predicts that landscape simplification is likely to increase insect pest outbreaks and limit their control by natural enemies, and this situation could boost insecticide use. Some studies have indeed detected that simpler landscapes were associated with higher insecticide use, but very few have demonstrated that this association is caused by landscape effects on pest abundance. Here, we analysed insecticide use and pest pressure in response to landscape simplification across 557 arable farms across France. Accounting for potentially confounding covariates, we found that lower cover of hedgerows in the landscape, but not semi natural areas, were associated with higher on-farm insecticide use. We also found that greater hedgerow coverage was associated with lower aphid pest pressure. Specifically, increasing the landscape-scale cover of hedgerows from 1 % to 3 % meant that insecticide use was halved. These findings suggest that restoring hedgerow cover at the landscape scale should be targeted in order to speed-up the ecological intensification of agriculture.

The tree row is covered by an understory vegetation strip (UVS), providing a beneficial habitat for many soil fauna, which could disperse through spillover to the crop alleys. However, such movements have never been directly studied. Our experiment investigated earthworm fluxes in the tree row vicinity using a trap technique, in a Mediterranean agroforestry alley cropping field cultivated with peas and planted with walnut trees. We assessed earthworm density at different distances from the UVS (0 m, 0.3 m, 1 m and 6 m) by hand sorting soil monoliths (25*25*30 cm) in spring 2019, at the start and the end of a two-month experiment. During this period, we detected earthworm fluxes by placing directional traps at 30 cm from the UVS border. Traps consisted of three glued plastic walls placed vertically in the soil. They delimited a soil block of 25*25 cm by 20 cm depth and were open on one side. More epigeic earthworms were found in the UVS and up to 30 cm from the UVS border than in the middle of the crop alley. By contrast, the earthworm Allolobophora chlorotica presented a homogeneous distribution in the plot. Trapped earthworms were mostly of the All. chlorotica species, and 1.6 times more earthworms were found in traps open towards the crop alley than in traps open towards the UVS. These results suggest that in spring, earthworms are moving more from the crop alley towards the UVS than in the other direction, probably using the tree row and its vicinity as a refuge against adverse summer conditions in the crop alley.

However, assessing agroecological transitions remains a methodological challenge. The objective of this research was to investigate to what extent existing multiscale and multidimensional assessment methods were suitable to assess agroecological transitions. We used a literature review to identify and select 14 existing multiscale and multidimensional assessment methods related to sustainable or resilient agriculture. We then analyzed these 14 methods according to five evaluation criteria that reflected key requirements for assessing agroecological transitions: 1) be adaptable to local conditions, 2) consider social interactions among stakeholders involved in the transitions, 3) clarify the concept of agroecology, 4) consider the temporal dynamics of the transitions to better understand barriers and levers in their development and 5) use a participatory bottom-up approach. The methods adopted different approaches to consider each evaluation criterion, but none of them covered all five. The two evaluation criteria most often employed were the adaptability to local conditions (used by 13 of the methods) and the consideration of social interactions (used by all 14 of the analyzed methods). To be adaptable, methods mobilized generic guidelines with flexible content and/or included a contextualization phase. For social interactions, most methods mobilized social-related indicators, and two included stakeholder mapping. Two methods clarified the agroecological concept by mobilizing different sets of principles. Two other methods considered temporal dynamics of the transitions, mobilizing a trajectory of change to understand barriers and levers in their development. Finally, seven methods adopted a bottom-up participatory approach, involving stakeholders in both their development and use. To balance the existing trade-offs between the evaluation purpose, the time requirement and the level of participation in the different approaches adopted by the 14 methods studied, we suggest combining some of the approaches in a complementary mode to cover all 5 criteria and therefore improve the assessment of agroecological transitions.

However, assessing agroecological transitions presents methodological challenges, including: 1) being adaptable to local conditions, 2) consideration of social interactions among stakeholders involved in transitions, 3) clarifying the concept of agroecology, 4) consideration of the temporal dynamics of the transitions to better understand barriers and levers in their development, and 5) using a participatory bottom-up approach. The objective of this research was to design a method that provided evidence on 1) the barriers and levers in the development of agroecological transitions, and 2) their performance related to four dimensions: techno-economic issues, agroecosystem health, quality of life and resilience. To design, test and adapt such a method, while also involving end-users, we adopted a co-design approach based on prototyping. The co-design approach unfolded in nine stages alternating research work and co-design with end-users. The prototype was built on the approaches of existing published methods covering the five challenges for assessing agroecological transitions. It consisted of a four chronological step assessment method. The first three steps consisted of framing the assessment, with the final step a multidimensional performance assessment, using an initial set of 73 indicators to cover the four dimensions. The prototype was then tested and adapted in the village of Sare Boubou, Senegal, which is going through an agroecological transition supported by a non-governmental organization. Changes during the testing and adaptation phase affected three steps of the prototype and allowed the initial prototype to adapt to the case study's specificities, related to its scale and context. Context-related changes particularly affected the performance assessment, with a total of 31 indicators changed. The analysis of barriers and levers revealed that the transition began 29 years ago, achieved a fair level of advancement and yet was still ongoing. Results revealed heterogeneity between the nine households of the village in terms of: uptake of agroecological practices, household resources, diversification of activities, coverage of food needs through production and level of sales. This heterogeneity explained the large variability in household multidimensional performances across all dimensions. Large disparities were also noticeable at the individual level between men, women and young men in the village regarding the level of education, empowerment and participation in knowledge sharing networks. Despite a method seen as time-consuming and data intensive, end -user validation acknowledged the comprehensiveness of the method and its usefulness for steering and managing agroecological transitions, making it possible to identify levers for action at different scales.

The aim of the study is to identify and characterise diversified systems as alternatives to the dominant model in olive and wine growing, using the innovation-tracking method. After defining the dominant system (bibliography, local advisers), the diversified systems were identified by interviewing 28 winegrowers and 18 olive growers using them. We distinguish three types of diversification: (1) with animals on sub-plots, (2) with perennial species mainly in the row or on the row, and (3) with annual species on the inter-row. Some associations are only possible in irrigated systems (market gardening). Diversification is mainly based on an existing plantation. For farmers, innovative systems meet environmental, agronomic and/or economic objectives. The majority of farmers were satisfied with their innovative systems, but mentioned specific disadvantages (e.g., harvesting difficulties in olive growing) that could be the subject of dedicated design work to adapt existing systems. A quarter of the winegrowers surveyed had received technical support in setting up their innovative system(s). No olive grower mentioned such support. All the farmers expressed this need to improve their systems and be reassured in their practices. Setting up an exchange network between farmers would be a first solution. It is also important to build references on the associations implemented in the plots, and to develop financial aid for diversification.

Tree management practices such as pollarding can be used to restore the crop light availability. We monitored durum wheat, barley and pea yields during three consecutive years in an alley-cropping agroforestry system with hybrid walnut trees in Southern France. Trees have been pruned regularly to 4 m since planting (in 1995), and a section of 50 trees was pollarded at 4 m height for the first time in 2013. We measured the yields and yields components in the two different tree management systems and in a sole crop control. The non-pollarded trees reduced significantly the incident light (around 80% of the global radiation left in average) and both wheat (68% of the control) and pea (69% of the control), but not barley mean yields. In pollards inter-row, the average incident light was 98% of the total radiation the first year and the wheat yield 89% of the control. But 3 years after pollarding, the incident light was 79% of the total radiation and the pea yield was only 67% of the control. Pollarding had a transient positive impact on crop yield; after 3 years, pollards were more competitive for light than control trees. Pollarding may also reduce the belowground trees competition, but slightly, as the crop vegetative growth occurs when the trees are leafless."

The shade pattern of an AV system is not typical and is quite different from the one of AF systems. Most countries allow AV systems on croplands only if the crop productivity is maintained (e.g., in France) or slightly reduced, as in Japan and Germany, with 80% and 66% minimum relative yield (RY) required, respectively. I suggest using the Ground Coverage Ratio (GCR: ratio of area of photovoltaic panels to area of land) as an indicator of the crop potential productivity in AV systems. The GCR can easily be computed and controlled for all kinds of AV systems with panels that are either fixed (horizontal, tilted, or vertical) or mobile (on 1- or 2-axis trackers). Here, I provide a synthesis of published data for crop productivity under AV systems. Only publications that provided both the GCR of the system and the crop RYs were included. Measuring RYs requires a reliable non-AV control plot. Several publications were excluded because of doubts regarding the measurements' validity (e.g., systems that are too small, resulting in strong edge effects, or unreliable control plots). Despite the scattering of results, a clear pattern is evidenced: RYs decrease rapidly when GCRs increase. It appears that a GCR < 25% is required to ensure that most crop RYs stay > 80%. These results are consistent with a recent meta-analysis examining the impact of shade on crops. The use of the GCR criterion to validate AV projects is a simple and cost-effective alternative to the tricky control of crop yields in the fields.

Field experimentation has been the primary approach to understanding the tree-crop interactions inherent in agroforestry. However, the number of field experiments has been limited by slow tree maturation and difficulty in obtaining consistent funding. Models have the potential to overcome these hurdles and rapidly advance understanding of agroforestry systems. Hi-sAFe is a mechanistic, biophysical model designed to explore the interactions within agroforestry systems that mix trees with crops. The model couples the pre-existing STICS crop model to a new tree model that includes several plasticity mechanisms responsive to tree-tree and tree-crop competition for light, water, and nitrogen. Monoculture crop and tree systems can also be simulated, enabling calculation of the land equivalent ratio. The model's 3D and spatially explicit form is key for accurately representing many competition and facilitation processes. Hi-sAFe is a novel tool for exploring agroforestry designs (e.g., tree spacing, crop type, tree row orientation), management strategies (e.g., thinning, branch pruning, root pruning, fertilization, irrigation), and responses to environmental variation (e.g., latitude, climate change, soil depth, soil structure and fertility, fluctuating water table). By improving our understanding of the complex interactions within agroforestry systems, Hi-sAFe can ultimately facilitate adoption of agroforestry as a sustainable land-use practice.

However, success has been seriously limited due to lack of thorough characterization of the impact of the diversity of farm household types on productivity, resource-use efficiency and economic and nutritional status. This study applied hierarchical ascendant classification to a random sample of 286 cereal-producing farm households in Morocco and identified distinct household typologies. It also carried out an analysis of trade-offs between economic, nutritional and environmental factors induced by the production decisions of the different farm household typologies. Our analysis identified three dominant farm household typologies in the production system, namely: (i) intensive predominantly-vegetable farming households with high input intensities, (ii) semi-intensive cereal mono-crop farming households with moderate input intensities and (iii) extensive mixed cereal-legume farming households with low input intensities. Extensive mixed cereal-legume farming households exhibited the highest resource-use efficiency and high biodiversity. These benefits, however, came at the expense of a much lower farm income and limited food supplies relative to the other two systems. These results show that, as is the case for many dryland regions, all three farm types showed precarious conditions for one or more of the sustainability-related indicators.

To address some of these challenges, governments are considering different incentives to increase crop production. However, incentives often entail trade-offs and may have diverging effects on economic, social, and environmental sustainability.OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the ex-ante effects of incentives targeted towards increasing crop production on the production and consumption decisions of farm households on the Salss plain of northern Morocco.METHODS: The assessment was conducted with a dynamic, intertemporal farm household model that simulates farm production and food consumption decisions. The model was calibrated using survey data from 85 farm households for 2014. Four scenarios were codesigned with local stakeholders and then simulated over a continuous 15-year period to capture rainfall variability: (1) increased availability of annual groundwater for irrigated cropping from 31 m3 ha-1 to 215 m3 ha-1, (2) a 15% increase in grain prices for cereals and legumes, (3) introduced drought tolerant crop varieties, and (4) a fourth scenario that combines all factors in the above three scenarios.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results showed that regardless of the scenario, the area of cereals and legumes cultivated only slightly changed compared to the Baseline scenario. However, according to the scenarios tested, the total production of cereals increased by 10% to 21% and of legumes increased by 2% to 9%. This production increase is the direct consequence of increased crop yields due to an intensification of crop production methods. The incentives increased the consumption of cereals and legumes by up to 43%. This increase was mainly due to a shift from grain to vegetable production that increases cash income, resulting in more food purchases from the market while consumption from own production dropped by up to 53%. The average increase in crop income was 14% in scenarios 1-3 and 28% in scenario 4. However, increased income had ramifications for nature resource stocks, with irrigation water use from groundwater increasing by 593% in the Water scenario and 320% in the combined scenario, relative to the Baseline scenario. In the Water scenario, incomes increased by 15% and nitrogen leached increased by 36%, highlighting the trade-off between economic and environmental sustainability.SIGNIFICANCE: These results show the challenges in obtaining acceptable compromises between the three sustainability pillars as the scenarios increased income but also led to increased groundwater extraction and nitrate leaching.

However, this hypothesis is largely based on studies about biological pest control service, and the effects of landscape context on pesticide use remain poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated how the proportion of host crops and semi-natural habitats affected the local use of fungicides and insecticides in the most treated crops in France, i.e., apple orchards and vineyards. METHODS: Using pesticide use information at the national level from 64 apple orchards and 138 vineyards monitored between 2014 and 2019, we investigated how local field size, several aspects of landscape context (proportion of host crops, share of organic host crop, proportion of woodlands and grasslands) as well as the weather context affect the frequency, timing and diversity of local fungicide and insecticide use. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that landscape-scale management could reduce the use of insecticides in agricultural landscapes. In vineyards, a lower use of insecticides was observed in small fields or landscapes composed of a high proportion of woodlands, while in orchards a lower local use of insecticides was found in landscapes with a high share of organic orchards. Fungicide use was mainly affected by the weather context in both apple orchards and vineyards, with more fungicide use in humid and warm weather. However, effects of vineyard size and grassland proportion on the date of the first spray suggest that these two variables may impact pathogen spatial dynamics, a topic that needs further investigations. SIGNIFICANCE: Landscape-scale management options highlighted in our study may contribute to the design of functional agricultural landscapes minimising pesticide use.

These yield gaps particularly occur in Mediterranean wine regions, where extreme events have intensified because of climate change. Yield gaps at the regional level have been widely studied in arable crops using big datasets, but much less so in perennial crops, such as grapevine. Understanding the environmental factors involved in yield gaps, such as those linked to climate and soil, is the first step in grapevine yield gap analysis. At a regional scale, there are numerous studies on 'terroir' linked to wine typicity and quality; however, none have classified spatial zones based on environmental factors identified as being involved in grapevine yield. In the present study, we aggregated into one big dataset information obtained from producers at the municipality level in the wine region Languedoc-Roussillon (South of France) between 2010 and 2018. We used a backward stepwise model selection process using linear mixed-effect models to discriminate and select the statistically significant indicators capable of estimating grapevine yield at the municipality level. We then determined spatial zones by using the selected indicators to create clusters of municipalities with similar soil and climate characteristics. Finally, we analysed the indicators of each zone related to the grapevine yield gap, as well as the variations among the grapevine varieties in the zones. Our selection process evidenced 6 factors that could explain annual grapevine yield annually (R2 = 0.112) and average yield for the whole period (R2 = 0.546): Soil Available Water Capacity (SAWC), soil pH, Huglin Index, the Climate Dryness Index, the number of Very Hot Days and Days of Frost. The clustering results show seven different zones with two marked yield gap levels, although all the zones had municipalities with no or high yield gaps. On each zone, grapevine yield was found to be driven by a combination of climate and soil factors, rather than by a single environmental factor. The white wine varieties showed larger yield gaps than the red and rose wine varieties. Environmental factors at this scale largely explained yield variability across the municipalities, but they were not performant in terms of annual yield prediction. Further research is required on the interactions between environmental variables and plant material and farming practices, as well as on vineyard strategies, which also play an important role in grapevine yield gaps at vineyard and regional scale."

In vineyards, service plants target specific services depending on the management strategy implemented by the winegrower, including the plant species, the surface covered, the plant growth control and destruction date. Understanding the management strategies linked to their associated target services at the regional scale is necessary to better help winegrowers, advisers and policy makers regarding an adapted use of service plants. To do this, we conducted a survey in 2016 among 334 winegrowers in Languedoc-Roussillon region in France, enquiring about their service plant management practices during the season 2014-2015. Given the diversity of the strategies of service plant management, we proposed a typology analyzing their spatial and temporal dimensions. Further, we present a Coverage Index (CI), which combines both temporal and spatial dimensions of the service plant management strategies. We conducted a multiple components analysis and clustering to create a vineyard typology and applied linear models to find correlations between the CI and specific vineyard characteristics. Three quarters of interviewed winegrowers sowed or maintained service plants in their vineyards; 41 % used a winter service plant strategy; 8.4 % a semi-permanent and 27.3 % a permanent service plant strategy. The preferred surface coverage strategy was full surface during grapevine dormancy and its reduction to half of the inter-rows after grapevine budburst. However, the diversity of surface coverage strategies during the grapevine vegetative period was remarkable. Lower water resources and specific soil characteristics were not linked to the service plant management strategies. Higher CI was associated with vineyards presenting quality labels (PDO and Organic), independent wine-making and lower target yields, showing that the added value of producing high quality wine plays an important role when implementing service plants in vineyards. Overall, our study showed: i) the popularity of spontaneous service plant strategies; ii) the spatial and temporal diversity of service plant management strategies and iii) the utility of the CI to study the implementation of service plants and to understand the motivations and constraints of their use."

FAN includes a series of environmental indicators that can be used to assess alternative scenarios in terms of ecosystem services, nutrient cycling, and resource autonomy. We use a French case study to demonstrate FAN's dynamics and to explore the sensitivity of key parameters. We show a strong influence of spatial distance between agents, their disposition to exchange, and their preference for specific materials on local agro-food network simulations. FAN is powerful theoretical tool to explore and assess opportunities for a circular economy in small farming regions and to unravel interactions between recycling, environmental performance and food production."

Innovative tools to explore the co-benefits and trade-offs of improving flow circularity in agro-food systems at different scales are needed to better understand the efficacy of these sustainability solutions. Here, we applied the FAN (""Flows in Agro-food Networks"") agent-based model to simulate contrasting scenarios of material flows locally in a small farming region of France. These scenarios aim to enhance: (1) best management practices at the farm scale; (2) organic material recycling and biogas production collectively across the agricultural landscape; and (3) system redesign toward complete local circularity through crop and livestock symbiosis, fewer livestock, and elimination of external inputs. Scenario simulation outcomes are assessed in terms of their degree of circularity and food production. We find that best management practices at the farm scale and collective solutions for recycling (organic fertilization and anaerobic digestion) substantially improved the degree of circularity by tightening the local nitrogen (N) cycle without affecting food production. Among other co-benefits, changes in farm rotations to feed livestock locally increased the degree of circularity without appreciably impacting food production. The maximum circularity scenario showed considerable potential to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however, they involved large trade-offs with food production that were even more pronounced with fewer livestock animals. Although regulating livestock numbers combined with eliminating chemical fertilizers was the most effective at mitigating GHG emissions, when applied simultaneously it substantially impacted food and bioenergy production. Such trade-offs for soil fertility demonstrate the importance of coupling crops and livestock for reaching self-sufficient circular systems. Our study illustrates how the FAN agent-based model can be applied to account for multiple types of interactions involved in transitions toward circularity in local agro-food systems, including the potential for co-benefits, and unintended consequences of interventions."

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that roots of 2 years old peach trees intercropped with grass can extract deep soil water below a shallow lithic discontinuity, composed of a layer of pebbles in a powdery calcareous matrix and that hardens in dry conditions. A peach tree orchard was planted on a soil with an average 0.5 m deep lithic discontinuity. Soil water content was measured every fortnight on the row and the inter-row with a neutron probe every 0.2 m up to 3 m depth. The contribution of each soil layer to trees and grass transpiration was simulated with a dynamic water balance model. Results show that tree roots grew through the lithic discontinuity and accessed a water refilled soil layer beneath it only 2 years after plantation, whereas grass roots did not grow below 0.5 m. Soil water content decrease up to 2 m depth after the cessation of irrigation was analysed as the result of tree water uptake. Tree water uptake simulations showed that soil layers below 1 m can contribute up to 17% of the total water uptake of the 2 years old trees. Our results suggest that a lithic discontinuity such as the one in our study may not be an impediment to the perennial trees root growth allowing them to access deep soil water. This suggests that soils with such a lithic discontinuity may be suitable for dryland agroforestry in which deep soil water available to the trees may help in reducing competition for water.

For example, the average treatment frequency index (TFI) for French vineyards was 13.5 in 2016, whereas the average TFI for wheat (a major annual crop in France) was 4.9 in 2017. Reducing pesticide use is a key issue to improve viticulture sustainability. The aims of this study were (i) to analyse the evolution of pesticide use in vineyard farms voluntarily participating in a pesticide reduction programme, and (ii) to understand the options winegrowers used to reduce their pesticide use. We analysed data from the DEPHY farm network, including 244 cropping systems followed over 10 years and spread across 12 winegrowing regions. We used the TFI to assess the intensity of pesticide use. Mean pesticide use within the network decreased over the 10-year period and mostly concerned fungicide use. By analysing several indicators such as the number of treatments and the mean TFI per fungicide treatment, we were able to identify some of the management options mobilised for achieving this pesticide reduction. The use of biocontrol products and the reduction of sprayed doses were often associated with a low TFI. The analysis of yield evolution showed a significant mean reduction, although it was smaller than the TFI reduction. This raised the question of the impact of pesticide reduction on productivity. Further trade-off analyses are required in the future.

But these practices must change to lower pesticide use and improve viticulture sustainability. Different options for curbing pesticide use exist, and they can be progressively implemented following a specific temporal scheme in each production system. Some change trajectories can be more efficient than others in limiting pesticide applications. Combining trajectory studies and typology may be helpful in characterizing how farmers change their practices and in summarizing the various production system trajectories possible when transitioning towards pesticide use reduction.OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were i) to identify different types of pesticide use trajectories, and ii) to understand the options implemented by winegrowers to reduce their pesticide use. METHODS: We analysed data from 161 farming systems in the DEPHY farm network in 12 French winegrowing regions over a 10-year period. Pesticide use was assessed with the treatment frequency index (TFI). We char- acterized the TFI trajectory of each farming system with six indicators and built a typology of TFI trajectories. We then analysed several indicators such as the use of biocontrol products and the dose sprayed to identify some of the management options chosen to achieve these pesticide use trajectories.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Three clusters were identified and characterized in terms of pesticide use strat- egy. The first cluster represented farms with an initial point close to the regional average and which did not experience a significant TFI reduction (-13%). The second cluster comprised farms with a low TFI when entering the network that were able to further reduce their TFI over time (-48%). The last cluster represented farms with a high initial TFI and a high reduction (-63%). All clusters managed to reduce their pesticide use by combining several technical levers at different intensities. Some differences in the levers between clusters were observed. Cluster 2 farms are in the process of converting to organic farming and using the associated levers such as biocontrol and mechanical weeding. SIGNIFICANCE: The changes implemented by cluster indicate a varying degree of progress in the transition to- wards pesticide use reduction. The initial point was identified as having a strong influence on the end result. The more intensively the technical levers were combined, the more difficult it was to reduce pesticide use. The DEPHY network supported winegrowers in their reduction of pesticides who managed to reduce their pesticide use by 13% to 63%.

However, because of the harmful effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, winegrowers have had to change their practices. To reduce pesticide use, winegrowers have a range of levers at their disposal that are implemented at different spatial and temporal scales and with different intensities of change. Beyond simply reducing pesticide use, these changes can also impact farms' economic and social performances notably because vine is a perennial crop with inertia in the impacts of changes operated. In this work, we assessed the covariation between various performances with time. We used the Agrosyst database, which compiles data on the performances of French vineyard cropping systems engaged in a pesticide reduction process for the past 10 years, implementing a reduction of 34%. Based on existing knowledge on transition processes and pesticide reduction in vineyards, we used partial least squares path modelling (PLSPM) to assess the dynamic trade-offs between different performances during the pesticide use reduction process. We verified the model we built (GoF = 0.44) and found no significant correlation between pesticide reduction, economic performances (operating costs and fuel consumption), technical performance (mechanical work time) or productivity (yield). Interestingly, we did not observe any effect from reducing fungicides on yield. We only noticed a significant correlation between the initial weed control strategy and the change in weed control strategy (beta = 0.18). Furthermore, stopping herbicide use did not affect mechanical work time or costs. Our results are encouraging in terms of maintaining both agronomic and economic performances when reducing pesticides in vineyards.

The aim of this study is to highlight which trait values are selected by each practice in different environmental conditions, with special references to Grime's CSR strategies. A combination of a multivariate analysis (RLQ) and the fourth-corner analysis was used to analyse 400 floristic samples belonging to 100 vineyards in the wine-growing region of Bordeaux (France). The main structure of vineyard weed communities was shaped by the opposition between mowing, favouring hemicryptophytes with a competitive strategy, and soil tillage, favouring therophytes and nutrient-demanding species with a ruderal strategy. Secondly, the vineyard weed communities differed according to the trophic status of the soil. Vineyards on acidic, sandy soils with low organic matter were characterised by small-seeded annuals with a stress-tolerant strategy whereas vineyards with clayey, calcareous soils rich in organic matter, harboured larger perennial nitrophilous species with large seeds and a competitive strategy. Our study is the first to show that weed species responded consistently to two independent gradients with specific traits associated with disturbance (life cycle and SLA) and soil resources (plant height and seed mass) gradients. Based on knowledge of the soil characteristics, it becomes possible to predict which type of weeds will develop according to the combination of practices applied on the vineyard rows and inter-rows.

In this study, we used a unique data set covering 46 vineyard plots in France (Champagne, Beaujolais and Languedoc winegrowing areas) with 883 flora surveys performed between 2006 and 2012. The three objectives of the present study were: (1) to characterize weed communities composition and structure (richness and abundance) in vineyards from three traditional winegrowing areas in France; (2) to evaluate the relative importance of spatial, temporal variables, environmental conditions and management practices on weed species composition and structure; (3) to determine whether or not weed composition and structure are affected by the same factors. The results of the study revealed that season (including timing of management practices) was the most important filter for weed communities in vineyards, opposing in each plot a spring community and a summer-autumn community. Furthermore, spatial variations between regions (latitude), soil types (pH) and inter-annual variations (2006 to 2012) were also seen to have a strong effect on species turnover. Farming practices explained an overall low variation in composition of weed communities but some species showed a high and consistent fit to contrasting practices. For example, herbicide applications (mostly glyphosate) promoted some species such as Malva sylvestris and Sorghum halepense whereas tillage in inter-rows selected typical annual weeds such as Cerastium glomeratum and Galium aparine. Farming practices had a much higher influence on species richness and abundance with equal effect of both herbicides and soil tillage for controlling weed species richness and abundance in inter-rows, but stronger effects of herbicides were observed on species abundance in the rows. Tillage along the rows and a combination of mowing and tillage along the inter-rows were associated to the highest level of weed richness and abundance. Our study suggests that grapevine growers have a limited ability to influence species composition (mostly determined by abiotic factors) but their choice of management can modulate the level of weed richness and abundance. Our results will contribute to guide farmers towards more integrated management practices, ensuring both an optimal management of the spontaneous vegetation in vineyards and allowing this vegetation to provide various ecosystem services."

Then we investigated statistical relations between aggregate stability, root traits and SOC and estimated root trait and SOC contributions to gain insight into aggregate stability.ResultsSoil management strategies strongly affected soil aggregate stability, with a negative effect of tillage, even after several years of service crop cover. Among the investigated parameters, soil organic carbon was found to contribute the most to aggregate stability. Root mean diameter and root mass density showed positive correlations with aggregate stability, while specific root length showed a negative correlation with aggregate stability.ConclusionsSoil aggregate stability is the result of complex interactions between soil management strategies, soil properties and plant root traits. Service crops improve aggregate stability, and a trait-based approach could help to identify service crop ideotypes and expand the pool of species of interest for providing services in agroecosystems in relation with the soil physical quality.

However, the importance of interspecific vs the intraspecific trait variability (ITV) for classifying species according to their traits in agrosystems on a large diversity of pedoclimatic situations and cropping systems remains still open. Here, we addressed three questions: How do measured traits vary across years and seasons? Are species rankings conserved across years and season? And which traits and species are the more stable and repeatable for sown and spontaneous species? We conducted a two-year experiment in a vineyard, and we measured four leaf and plant functional traits of 14 sown species and 43 spontaneous species that grew among sown species. Traits were measured at two key phenological stages for grapevine: budburst and flowering during two successive years with contrasted rainfall (2017 and 2018). We studied seasonal and interannual trait variations, rankings between species, and variance partitioning. The species factor explained the greatest part of trait variations across years and seasons. Sown and spontaneous species traits varied in the same way, and traits related to plant dry matter contents were the more stable across periods. Moreover, species rankings were conserved across years and seasons for all traits except plant height. Sown species showed better ranking conservation than spontaneous species overall. The trait-based approach seems promising for the comparison of various cropping systems involving sown and spontaneous species, and may help identifying service crop species related to specific agroecosystem services. Further research is needed to bring more knowledge on trait variations under a diversity of agrosystems, and to improve theoretical frameworks that would help the design of sustainable agrosystems that provide multiple ecosystem services.

Scientific literature barely considers the importance of service crop management to reach trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices. This study evaluates during a three-year experiment, 6 service crop termination strategies for winter service crops, combining two service crops termination periods (early termination in February vs. termination at grapevine budburst) and three termination methods (mower (M), mower + tillage (T), roller-crimper (R)). Service crop (biomass, C:N ratio, weeds, and mulch following termination), soil ( soil organic matter, microbial biomass, and water and nitrogen stocks), and grapevines (predawn leaf water potential, yield components, delta 13C, yeast assimilable nitrogen in juice, and pruning weight) were monitored from 2019 to 2022. Allowing service crops to develop until the budburst of the vine resulted in a two to three-fold increase in biomass compared to early destruction. Termination involving soil tillage was the most effective method, as treatments destroyed early with soil tillage exhibited almost no regrowth. Soil tillage termination led to the lowest biomass of weeds at the grapevine flowering two years out of three, and prevented the regrowth of certain sown plants, especially Poaceae. The roller was less effective in destroying service crop species but was the best method for maintaining plant residues on the soil surface. A higher soil microbial biomass was observed with termination at budburst, combined with no-till termination methods. Termination involving soil tillage was notably more effective in stopping service crop transpiration, increasing soil water stocks and improving grapevine water status. In 2020 and 2022, soil inorganic nitrogen stocks were almost 4 times higher in the T treatments compared to the other two termination methods, achieving a level of approximately 61 kg ha-1 that closely corresponds to the annual nitrogen requirements of grapevines. The yeast-assimilable nitrogen (YAN) content in grape juice mirrored this trend. Pruning weight varied significantly between different termination methods, with T treatments exhibiting a higher pruning weight per vine in comparison to R and M treatments. In general terms, the T treatment had a significantly higher number of bunches, the M treatment had the lowest, and the R treatment exhibited intermediate values. Overall, the average grapevine yield ranged from 7.25 to 13.7 t ha-1, corresponding to 52-98 hL ha-1 (with 4000 vines ha-1, 140 kg hL-1). This level of production may be accepted for Protected Designations of Origin that limit grapevine yield to 40 or 60 hL ha-1, but it could be a limitation for Protected Geographical Indications, which permit 90 hL ha-1, or unlabeled productions without yield limitations. Given the Mediterranean climate context, with rising frequencies of dry winters due to climate change, termination involving soil tillage appears to be the least risky strategy to preserve grapevine vigor and production while improving soilbased ecosystem functions. However, this might be contingent on the targeted yield and wine valuation.

This study aimed to test the relationships between service crop functional traits and two related services of major interest in viticulture: runoff control and water provisioning. Methods We measured the water stock, the cover rate, along with above- and belowground functional markers of 38 plant communities after a winter growing season in an experimental vineyard, to assess relationships between service crop functional markers, runoff control and water provisioning. Results Both aboveground and belowground functional markers were significant predictors of service provision at the community level. The plant aboveground dry matter content was positively related to soil water stocks and negatively related to the cover rate of the communities, while the specific leaf area (SLA) was positively related to the cover rate. The rooting depth and morphological root traits (specific root length and very fine root fraction) were negatively related with the soil water stock. Moreover, these results agree with ecological theories about the relationships between plant functional markers, plant ecological strategies and resources use. Conclusions The identification of functional markers related to service provision may help us to select species or communities service crops that could perform interesting trade-offs between multiple services due to a suited combination of related markers, and provide insights for plant selection in order to breed plant varieties and cultivars with the aim of providing agroecosystem services.

As ammoniacal nitrogen produced by urea hydrolysis just after deep application is chemically stable in the anaerobic layer of the paddy soil, it is relevant to study the diffusion-exchange phenomenon affecting this ammoniacal-N. More precisely, numerical calculus was called on to solve the nonlinear diffusion-exchange equation, admitting spherical symmetry in this context. The adsorption isotherm for ammoniacal-N intervening in this equation was a Freundlich isotherm. Experiments performed in the laboratory (untransplanted situation) and in the field (transplanted situation) enabled the monitoring of the time course of ammoniacal-N concentration in the central position. The tortuosity factor was evaluated at 0.80 in the paddy soil. In the field, the diffusion-exchange phase was clearly separated from the ammonia assimilation phase. The limit between the two was evaluated in six replicates. The first-order mechanism of ammonia disappearance is interpreted as the indication of a tight physiological regulation at the carbon-nitrogen interface acting within roots pushed to their limit in growth and assimilative capacity. This limit is here reported at 12 mM ammonia, attained 39 d after point application. This delay is enhanced when the tortuosity factor is reduced. Similar modelling in the context of cylindrical symmetry can be an option to study new urea fertilizers in the form of urea rods.

Weeds are known to deliver supporting or regulating services but their potential to provide provisioning services is less studied. Our study aims to quantify the potential of weeds to provide forage resources for livestock in two Mediterranean perennial agroecosystems: olive groves and vineyards. We used a trait-based approach to investigate the abiotic determinants of weed quality and quantity variations at both the species and community levels. We surveyed spontaneous vegetation in 16 vineyards and 16 olive groves in the French Mediterranean region with contrasting pedoclimatic conditions and agricultural practices, during spring and fall 2021. Four leaf traits were measured: Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC), Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Leaf Nitrogen Content (LNC) and leaf C/N ratio (Leaf C/N) and four forage potential indicators: dry matter digestibility (DMD), crude proteins (CP), neutral detergent fiber content (NDF) and aboveground biomass (AB). We found that DMD of perennial agroecosystems weeds is high (689 +/- 116 g kg-1), and can be compared to those of forage species. Using linear mixed models and path analysis, we found that, at the community scale, LDMC is negatively linked to weed forage quality and that disturbing agricultural practices like tillage, increase weed forage quality. However we did not find any effect of agricultural practices or pedoclimate on weeds leaf traits or on weeds quantity. Our results revealed the potential of weeds as highly digestible forage resources for livestock. The long-term aim is to promote the integration of livestock in perennial cropping systems in order to reduce the use of herbicides and/or tillage and to diversify agricultural production.

They are known to have the potential to provide additional floral resources for insects in flower-poor agroecosystems. However, their floral traits are much more scarcely studied than those of plants found in other habitats, such as grasslands. The aim of this study was to describe the floral phenotype of weeds and to determine to what extent their floral traits match their ecological strategies as described based on leaf traits. We cultivated 19 forb weeds from perennial agroecosystems, previously identified in Mediterranean fields, in a greenhouse for seven months and collected data on 12 floral and five leaf traits. We tested whether these traits covaried and exhibited an ecological strategy at the phenotype scale. We found that in matters of flower production, weed species face a tradeoff: either numerous small, low-stature flowers with small quantities of pollen and nectar, or few, large, higher-held flowers with more pollen and nectar. The floral traits were found to reflect Grime's CSR strategies: the weed species producing fewer but costlier flowers belonged to C-strategy species, whereas those producing more but less costly flowers belonged to species dominated by an R strategy. These findings indicate that the potential of weeds as floral resources for insects is related to their ecological strategies, which are known to be affected by agricultural practices that filter species composition. This implies that, as for the provision of other ecosystem services, weed communities can be managed to select species with floral traits matching the requirements of flower-visiting insects like pollinators or parasitoid wasps.

Because agricultural landscapes are often poor in flowers, it seems crucial to assess weeds as floral resources to feed flower-visiting insects and to identify the factors that drive floral productivity, defined as floral biomass produced by the weed community. We monitored floral presence, productivity and traits in 16 olive groves from September 2021 to June 2022. The objectives were to understand to which extinct abiotic factors, among agricultural practices, pedoclimate and weather, determine floral productivity and to analyse the relationships between floral traits, floral presence and productivity. We found mowing frequency (2-3 per year on average) increased mean floral area and height, advanced flowering onset, and increased floral functional diversity and flowering species richness, which in turn increased floral presence and productivity.

Agroforestry systems are of growing interest and viewed as possible alternative to conventional cropping systems in the context of climate change. Our aim was to evaluate the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities against drought with or without heat stress at different distances from the tree row in an agroforestry system as compared to a conventional cropping system. Soils were sampled at several distances from the tree row in a 21-year-old walnut agroforestry system and a contiguous conventional crop in Southern France. We simulated two cycles of drying-rewetting under controlled conditions and applied three distinct treatments: control (without stress), drought and drought combined with heat stress. We monitored microbial respiration over the incubation period. The inorganic N and microbial biomass C, N and P contents (MBC, MBN and MBP) were assessed during the drying period (resistance), just after rewetting and at the end of the experiment (resilience), while bacterial and fungal abundances were measured at the end of the resistance period. We demonstrated that an agroforestry system can induce spatial heterogeneity in soil microbial biomass and functions under control conditions. Microbial biomass and activity, soil organic matter (SOM) and mineral N levels increased on the tree row. This spatial heterogeneity pattern was preserved for soil microbial response to drought combined or not with heat. Microorganisms sampled in the middle of the interrow or in the conventional crop exhibited highest biomass resistance and lowest resilience when facing combined drought and heat stress. Soil microbial biomass resistance and resilience were similar whatever the spatial position when microorganisms had to deal with drought stress only. Our findings suggested that despite higher SOM content, microbial biomass and activity at and near the tree row, the legacy effect of the tree row did not lead to higher ecological stability under stressful climatic conditions. We also demonstrated that soil microorganisms can considerably change their stoichiometry depending on the stress treatment. Soil microorganisms showed elevated MBC:MBN, MBC:MBP and variable MBN:MBP during the resistance period. A high stoichiometric flexibility of microorganisms was observed when exposed to drought stress only, while stoichiometric changes were irreversible when exposed to combined drought and heat stress.

Diversification of cropping systems has been proposed as a solution to address these issues and promote sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. While alternatives have been proposed by research and development, changing the agricultural systems remains a huge challenge. Engaging local actors when considering those changes is important for their successful implementation. While co-designing with stakeholders is gaining interest in the scientific community, approaches that consider varying local contexts remain uncommon. In this study, our aim was to co-design, during workshops with local stakeholders, diver-sification options in five case studies located in the Mediterranean countries of Algeria, France, Greece, and Spain. Prior to the co-design process, we conducted a SWOT/PESTLE analysis in each case study to analyze the local context of current and potential agricultural systems. Our hypothesis was that co-designed systems would differ between case studies, according to their environmental, social and political contexts leading to fine-tuned locally ad hoc systems. Options for intercropping and diversifying rotations were considered for both cereal -based systems and vine systems. Additionally, these options included adapted management practices for cereal-based systems and more innovative diversification, such as photovoltaic panels or agroforestry, for vine systems. While some of these options could serve as adaptations to climate change, they may not be sufficient to address future climate conditions. Interestingly, we did not observe significant differences among the system options designed for the various case studies, even though the local contexts were very different. Indeed, options only partially addressed the issues identified by stakeholders: primarily, economic and environmental threats. This study points to the advantage of participatory research in diverse contexts along with cross-case analyses, and to the need to consider the future of these Mediterranean regions, where crop diversification is limited by water deficit. To foster the transition next steps should consider assessing experimentally these systems with farmers to stimulate learning, while considering market possibilities.

Some studies have used quantitative models at the farm scale to analyze the resilience of farming systems but with little involvement of stakeholders. We used a participatory approach with local actors on the Sais plain of Morocco to design possible future states and qualitatively assess the resilience of typical farm types (FTs) experiencing major change. Our approach combined individual interviews of farmers and local actors, mainly public, with participatory collective meetings to identify representative FTs and their performance, project their evolutions and future performance in the face of change, and evaluate their resilience. Performance, defined according to literature, interviews and meetings, included different types of capital, income, yields, markets, support of public policies, and water access. Four FTs were considered: highly irrigated horticulture (FT1), rainfed cereals (FT2), partly irrigated cereal-legumes (FT3), and mostly irrigated fruit-tree/horticulture (FT4). The primary driver for FT2 and FT3 was climate change; for FT1 and FT4, it was limiting access to water resources. Participants designed more diversified systems for all FTs in relation to those changes. Rankings of FT performance did not change between current and future states. Performance did not evolve significantly, but FT4 was seen as the most resilient and FT2 the least. These qualitative results differ somewhat from other studies mobilizing quantitative approaches, but they highlight the potential of local adaptation to limit the impacts of global change on vulnerable agriculture."

The root growth of apple trees in the top 60 cm was restricted by intercropping in the cropped area but increased in the top 40 cm in the uncropped area compared with monoculture. In the high rainfall period, compared with the control, the apple trees' water absorption from the uncropped area (0-60 cm) increased by 44.43%, but the water utilization from the cropped area (0-60 cm) decreased by 32.59%. More than 90% of the soil water absorbed by B. napus came from the 0-60 cm soil layer in the cropped area. During the low rainfall period, intercropping promoted an increase of 14.79% in apple trees' water absorption from the 60-100 cm soil layer in the cropped area. The soil water in the 20-60 cm layer became the main source for B. napus and its contribution was 63.51%, but only 20.56% of the water absorbed by apple trees came from here. It can be concluded that, to alleviate water competition, water absorption between species was segregated horizontally during the wet period due to the roots ""niche differentiation"", while water use complementarity occurred along the vertical axis during the dry period."

However, these management operations impose a stress on the trees, increase production costs and given the complexity of ACS; they may not lead to an increase in crop yield. Thus, the objective of this study was to measure the impact of root pruning in a Mediterranean ACS on soil water content and on the yield of two varieties each of barley and durum wheat. To achieve this, an experiment with three different treatments was conducted: monocrop (MC), and two 23-year-old hybrid walnut ACS, with (ACS_RP +) and without (ACS_RP-) root pruning. In each system, grain yield and yield components were measured and the microclimate and soil water content were recorded during the growing season. The ACS had lower incident radiation in the understory than MC and this radiation was unevenly distributed along the alley. Besides, ACS had lower air temperature during the day and higher at night in comparison with MC. Also, soil water content was higher in ACS than in MC. Within ACS, the soil water content was similar until the tree budburst but thereafter lower in ACS_RP-. The grain yield of both cereals was lower in ACS than in MC. Among the ACS there were no differences in grain yield or in any yield component for both cereals. From the above, it can be concluded that, under the conditions presented in the study, the root pruning increased the water available for the crops, but this did not increase crop yield. It is inferred that the main limiting factor for grain yield in the studied ACS was other than soil water."

The increasing costs of agricultural production, poor water and energy infrastructure, loss of agricultural land due to urban expansion, fragmented resource management, and unsustainable management practices all contribute to this vulnerability to climate change. This highlights the urgent need for innovative practices in farming systems. Within the framework of the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus, this paper explores innovative practices in dryland farming systems, by assessing their impact on water, energy, food, and ecosystem through stakeholder perception. In this work, we aim to present a systems approach for assessing the resilience of the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus in arid and semiarid regions. By using a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) approach, the study-which focuses on the F & egrave;s-Mekn & egrave;s region in Morocco-involves local actors to help researchers identify the key variables in order to assist farmers in their adaptation to climate change. The findings revealed different priorities between farmers and other stakeholders regarding the adoption of agricultural innovations. Farmers prioritize innovations that guarantee higher profitability and more market opportunities, such as integrating olive trees with cereal crops, by highlighting the importance of sustainable income sources. Meanwhile, stakeholders, such as researchers, engineers, government officials, and agribusiness entrepreneurs, prioritize innovations that emphasize high water use efficiency, which is crucial for the resilience of dryland farming areas: for instance, rainwater harvesting or the use of drought-resistant crop varieties that directly address the need for water conservation. But in doing so they are overlooking broader aspects within the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus."

Existing numerical models focus either on the structure or on the functions of agroforestry systems. However, both of these aspects are necessary, as function influences structure and vice versa. Here, we present a representation of agroforestry systems based on combinatorial maps (which are a type of multidimensional graphs), that allows conceptualizing the structure-function relationship at the agroecosystem scale. We show that such a model can represent the structure of agroforestry systems at multiple scales and its evolution through time. We propose an implementation of this framework, coded in Python, which is available on GitHub. In the future, this framework could be coupled with knowledge based or with biophysical simulation models to predict the production of ecosystem services. The code can also be integrated into visualization tools. Combinatorial maps seem promising to provide a unifying and generic description of agroforestry systems, including their structure, functions, and dynamics, with the possibility to translate to and from other representations.

Climate influence on grapevine physiology can vary depending on the terroir. A better understanding of these local terroir variations is likely to be achieved with analyses that use local data; i.e., farm/vineyard data. Thus, the challenge lies in exploiting farm data to enable grape growers to understand their own terroir and consequently adapt their practices to the local conditions. In such a context, this article proposes an analytical process to site-specifically study climate influence on grapevine physiology by focusing on time series of the weather data often contained in farm data sets. This article focuses on temperature and precipitation influence on yield in the form of a case study. The analytical process includes the Extended Growing Degree Days (eGDD) and the Bayesian functional Linear regression with Sparse Steps functions (BLiSS) methods in order to detect site-specific periods of strong climate influence on grapevine yield. It uses data from three commercial vineyards situated in the Bordeaux region (France), California (USA) and Israel. In general, the periods of climate influence on grapevine yield detected for the three vineyards identified the same stages of yield development, which have already been studied in the scientific literature. However, some vineyard differences were observed, including: i) different periods of influence associated with a given stage of yield development between the vineyards, ii) different influential weather variables between the three vineyards for a given period, and iii) differing duration of the period of influence associated with a given stage of yield development between the vineyards. These results show the potential of the proposed analytical process for analysing the time series of farm weather data in order to extract site-specific climate indicators of grapevine yield."

The information about current and future yield, termed a yield assessment in this paper, is an essential decision-making element for the grape and wine industry. Crop management, wine-making, commercial, accounting and strategic operations are all adapted to and all impact on the expected yield of the current vintage. Numerous yield assessment approaches have been proposed in the scientific literature. However, only a few of them have considered their adaptation to the operational context under the constraints, needs and strategies of commercial vineyards and wineries. The few studies that have worked on the operational implementation of yield assessment methods have only partially addressed this issue, concentrating their improvement efforts on a single step in the yield assessment process. This paper first proposes to review the characteristics of yield development in an operational context that must be taken into account by yield assessment methodsThese characteristics are consolidated into three main challenges for yield assessment methods: (i) addressing the complex temporality of yield development, (ii) ensuring a local monitoring of yield development and (iii) fitting to the operational needs and constraints to allow for relevant decision support systems in the field. The approaches of yield estimation, prediction and forecast are discussed in the context of these challenges. In a second step, the paper proposes a generic framework for the yield assessment process, including a review of the variables that are used to explain grapevine yield. Issues and proposals from the literature associated respectively with measurement, sampling and yield modelling are reviewed and the need for improved modelling of relationships between explanatory variables and the desired, reported yield variable is discussed. The yield assessment methods found in the literature are categorised and compared according to measurement, estimation and modelling approaches, and then according to the three challenges identified for yield assessment in operational conditions, such that the yield assessment method is adapted to commercial needs and not to research objectives. In conclusion, concrete proposals for new grape yield assessment methods are discussed in order to investigate the as yet unexplored opportunities for the improvement in yield assessment in operational contexts that have been identified in the paper. These considerations could easily be transposed to other perennial crops.

However, in the agronomic literature, it is commonly accepted that calendars based on a thermal index allow a better representation of the actual state of development of the plant. This paper aims to demonstrate that potential new information at the block scale can be revealed by adjusting a NDVI time series extracted from Sentinel 2 images using a site-specific thermal index. This is achieved by removing part of the inter-annual differences in the time-series that is due to variations in phenology by using a temperature-based time adjustment. To do so, the paper is based on an operational case study in viticulture exploring whether a link between NDVI profiles and the consistency over years of harvest quality parameters could be hypothesised at the block scale.

Here we propose to connect knowledge on the tree itself with knowledge on the system in which it is grown. In both cases, scientific advances are intrinsically connected with practical aspects. It is first shown that although whole -tree shape variability presents a descriptive interest it is not strictly related to the fruiting pattern, which is a major issue for apple cultivation. Architectural analyses have been developed not only to gain knowledge on the dynamics of tree growth and branching but also to analyse thoroughly the physiological conditions for an optimized fruit-set, fruit quality, and return -bloom. Shoot length and the physiological abortion of young shoots on the same branch (extinction) have shown to be two main components for regular yield and high -quality fruiting. These architectural analyses have also been at the origin of an innovative pruning procedure, artificial spur extinction, developed under the paradigm of precision horticulture. It is implemented in various training systems. The sustainability of intensive apple growing systems is now questioned, especially because of their high dependency on external inputs whether phytosanitary products or fertilizers. Agroforestry, i.e., growing woody perennials and annuals in spatial mixtures and/or temporal sequences, is proposed as a means to reduce such dependencies. It uses plant biodiversity to enhance ecological services including multiple cropping. For apple, the social -economic acceptability and performance of such systems have to be investigated. From the horticultural point of view, this new context challenges the choice of plant material and of training and pruning concepts developed in intensive orchards. From the scientific point of view, apple tree -based agroforestry systems address architectural and physiological issues on how the apple tree can develop and fruit satisfactorily in such biotic and abiotic contexts.

They have been progressively replaced, especially after World War II, by monocropping horticulture. These specialized systems are highly productive but also need high nutrient and phytosanitary inputs. There is now an increasing interest for biodiversitybased agrosystems with the assumption that increasing plant functional diversity in and around the plot is an efficient lever to reduce these inputs. Indeed, biodiversity is put forward as a way to promote various ecosystem services, including pest regulation and nutrient recycling, and is at the core of agroecology concepts developed a century ago. However, combining agricultural plants grown for production and ""companion"" plants grown for other services in the same plot needs more study on how the agricultural plant is affected by a generally more competitive context. The focus of our study was the effects of shade, known as a main factor characterizing multispecies systems, especially agroforestry systems, on tree architecture and flowering of a temperate and a tropical species, apple and mango. Overall, our results showed that the effects of the light environment, possibly modified by a diversified agrosystem, has a key role on the architecture and functioning of the agricultural plant, affecting both vegetative and reproductive compartments, and their relationships. This is especially true for fruit trees for which there are carry-over effects across years related to the perennial structural framework. Our study therefore strongly suggests that to strengthen the potential agronomic interest in diversified agrosystems, the holistic view at the core of the system approach needs to be complemented by more knowledge on how the agricultural plant interacts with its biotic environment."

Both apple productivity and aesthetic quality of the fruit have been strongly improved resulting from genetic improvement, optimization of tree training and pruning, and orchard design and management. However, these improvements were also done at the expense of an increasing dependence on external inputs such as water, fertilizers and synthetic pesticides. This dependence is now questioned because of the generated environmental pollutions and health issues. In the last decades, an increasing amount of initiatives have been developed that open the way towards more sustainable apple production systems. Concepts as well as on-station and on-farm works are developed in various contexts such as 'integrated fruit production', 'organic farming' and 'agroecology' with the objectives to increase biological regulations of pests and diseases and/or to improve soil fertility. All together results point out the importance of diversifying resources and habitats for beneficial arthropods in the orchard and its vicinity to foster ecosystem services related to pest suppression and to adopt cultural practices enhancing soil fertility. They also indicate some practical guidelines consisting in a better management of grass alleys and lining hedgerows within and around the orchard, respectively. From a more prospective view and taking inspiration from tropical fruit-tree based agroforestry, these works suggest that combining apple trees with other herbaceous and woody plants with various uses (soft fruit, aromatic plants, etc.) opens to more resilient agroecosystems, possibly mitigating climate change. These works also enlarge our vision of the current apple orchard towards a multiproduction system including apple among other productions. From the 'plant science' point of view the idea to grow apple in agroecosystems challenges current knowledge of the plasticity of the apple tree physiology and architecture, and agronomic performance, in response to interactions with neighbouring plants. It also stimulates necessary collaborations with other research fields such as socio-economics, for example on how the grower may handle those complex agroecosystems, optimize labour and valorize production.

To reduce this dependence, various initiatives have been developed in past decades, such as Integrated Fruit Production, Organic Farming, and more recently, Agroecology which is strongly inspired by research in ecology. These initiatives include plant diversity as the main driver to improve the sustainability of the orchard. Plant diversity can either be planned (choice of productive and not productive species) or associated (unintentional) and at different scales (within the cultivated plot and/or the surrounding landscape). To increase plant biodiversity, companion, i.e., mostly non-productive, plants can be either herbaceous, bushes, or trees. The interest of plant diversity to improve the sustainability of agrosystems is documented from three points of view: composition, structure, and function. First, companion plants have to fulfil precise functions within the system, such as sustaining nitrogen provisioning (e.g., herbaceous legumes between fruit-tree rows), hosting natural enemies of main pests, or attracting herbivore insects outside the orchard. Recent works on agroecology analyze fruit-tree based agrosystems documenting fruit production and the various ""services"" (e.g., mitigation of CO2 emission, soil nitrogen availability) companion plants can provide. Second, to optimise plant functioning, it is necessary to define rules of plant assemblage at spatial (e.g., distance between plants) and temporal (e.g., plantation at the same time period or not) levels. Based on a literature survey and current experiments, we will show that agrosystems that combine trees grown for fruit and possibly for timber or firewood and agricultural crops, i.e., fruit-tree based agroforestry systems (FT-AFS), provide promising results in the temperate climate context, including the Mediterranean zones. Further, the introduction of plants providing pest regulation services opens to challenging perspectives toward friendly fruit-tree-based agrosystems."

It could also alleviate excessive light and temperature in high-radiation regions of the world. However, little is known about the long-term shade adaptation of the temperate fruit tree in agroforestry systems. A study was developed to investigate apple growing under walnut trees in two shade conditions compared to a full light condition. Our aim was to quantify the plasticity of traits and the covariations between traits in these three light conditions using a multiscale approach considering different scales from whole tree to annual shoot and inflorescence. Shade did not affect the height of the apple trees, while it reduced the diameter of the trunk and branches. On the other hand, the total number of growing shoots was reduced in shade, and flowering and fruiting were fewer and more irregular than in full light. Strikingly, at the whole tree scale, covariations between vegetative traits (trunk cross-sectional area versus mean branch cross-sectional area) and between vegetative and reproductive traits (trunk cross-sectional area versus total number of inflorescences) were not altered by shade. However, at the shoot scale, return-bloom was significantly reduced by shade, whereas at the inflorescence scale shade did not affect leaf number or leaf area. We propose a shade adaptation syndrome that includes not only shade intensity but also shade dynamics during the growing season and over consecutive years.

After trimming, tree reaction occurred in all the scales. Trees are modular organisms within which each scale has attributes enabling them to optimize different functions. Among these functions, space exploration and light interception are strong determinants of tree productivity and survival. By modifying the crown shape, including foliage dispersion in the 3D space and carbon allocation, tree trimming (i.e. the removal of the higher part of the crown) may largely influence how trees fulfill the space exploration and light interception functions. In this study, we used field measurements of tree annual shoots combined with tree reconstruction from Terrestrial Laser Scanning data to analyze how different scales of the tree architecture complement each other to fulfill different functions simultaneously or combine to fulfill one single function more efficiently. We used morphological and functional variables measured at the annual shoot, axis, and tree scales to compare the architectural and functional strategies of two Fraxinus pennsylvanica cultivars and observe how trimming modifies these strategies. Results show that the two cultivars exhibit different strategies. One cultivar tended to optimize the space exploration function at both the annual shoot and axis scales and to optimize the light interception by displaying a large leaf area at the tree scale. The other cultivar tended to optimize light interception efficiency at both axis and tree levels. In both cultivars, trimming improved light interception efficiency and increased investments into space exploration. Nevertheless, after trimming, the two cultivars maintained their main architectural and functional strategy.

The most advanced forms of DFS include perennial components (e.g., perennial crops, trees), functionally different plants and livestock, and landscape heterogeneity. These characteristics make it more difficult to assess DFS in agricultural sciences, which have focused to date mainly on low-diversity systems. We provide an overview of the main methodological issues involved in assessing DFS, and their potential solutions. We identify five key methodological challenges for assessing DFS: i) combining conceptual frameworks from different disciplines to develop a holistic view of DFS multi-performance; ii) characterizing DFS structure from a functional perspective to define the relevant spatial extent to assess them; iii) considering DFS ontogeny i.e. the time required for DFS to establish, reach maturity and achieve a dynamic steady state when assessing their performance; iv) aggregating and mapping multiple performance indicators to integrate the range of products and services generated by DFS and to reveal potential synergies and antagonisms; v) defining and characterizing the reference systems used to compare DFS, as systems might differ in history, composition, management, soil-climate, and sociotechnical conditions. These challenges underline the need to overhaul as"

However, its performance remains weak, with an average national yield of no more than 3.6 tons ha(-1) and low profitability. Overall, on-farm wheat production will need to increase considerably to meet future demand and ensure minimum profitability for farmers. To this end, this study aims to identify the main levers for improving durum wheat crop performance. For this purpose, we have developed a regional bio-economic model by linking a biophysical model (CROPSYST) with an economic optimization model (MORBIT). CROPSYST was used to establish a database with a view to determining the relationships between farming practices, durum wheat yields, and water productivity within a context of high climate variability. The database was then integrated into a MORBIT model that analyzed the effects of farming practices on durum wheat performance and regional profits. Three scenarios related to irrigation control and the increase in durum wheat prices were developed. The results showed that reconciling irrigation practices with economic policies is the best alternative to improve durum wheat performance and increase profits at a regional level.

This complexity must be taken into account when designing farming systems to improve sustainability, but more methods are needed to be able to do so. This article seeks to apply the Hierarchical Patch Dynamics theory (HPD) to farming systems to understand farming system complexity and be better able to support farming system re-design. A six-step framework is proposed to adapt the HPD theory to farming system analysis by taking into account (i) spatial and temporal interactions and (ii) field and management diversity. This framework was applied to a vineyard case study. The result was a hierarchical formalization of the farming system. The HPD framework improved understanding and enabled the formalization of (i) the hierarchical structure of the farming system, (ii) the interactions between structure and processes and (iii) scaling up and down from field to farm scale. HPD theory proved to be successful in analyzing farming system complexity at the farm scale. The framework can help with specific aspects of farming system design, such as how to change the scale of study or determining which scale should be used when choosing indicators for crop management and integrating multi-scale constraints and processes.

Although grapevine trunk diseases are one of the most studied causes, the decline is multifactorial and associated with more than 70 factors, including abiotic and biotic hazards. With so many factors to consider, the phenomenon is difficult to understand. Our study aims to make it easier to determine and assess grapevine decline by focusing on three key indicators: yield, mortality and vegetative vigour. We investigated the relationships between these indicators from both a temporal and spatial perspective to propose a set of diagnostic indicators. Thus, we conducted a winegrower survey, a historical analysis of grapevine decline and field measurements of the abovementioned indicators on plot networks in three major French winegrowing regions (see graphical abstract): Bordeaux, Cognac and Languedoc. We found that winegrowers' perceptions of decline were consistent with an objective characterisation based on field measurements of the indicators. Although vine mortality progressively spread over the years, neither the survey nor the historical analysis showed a direct link between decline and yield loss. Rather, large yearly fluctuations in yield, which did not systematically decrease over time, account for this finding. As a result, the mortality rate and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) indicators were shown to be earlier indicators of grapevine decline than yield loss (addressed from the yield achievement ratio, YAR). We performed a multifactorial analysis of the overall data set from the three regions to deepen our understanding of the diversity of declining situations and the underlying environmental and management factors contributing to decline. Finally, two ground-based NDVI indicators and an image-analysis methodology using aerial photographs were proposed as easy-to-obtain indicators of grapevine decline. NDVI indicators were linearly correlated with both the YAR and mortality rate. This study provides a better understanding and promising tools for the early diagnosis of grapevine decline.

One major change in vineyard practices includes replacing chemical pesticides with copper and sulfur-based products in line with Council Regulation (EC) No. 834/2007. This change can make overall management and pest and disease control more difficult and potentially lead to yield losses. From 2013 to 2016, a network of 48 vineyard plots, in southern France, under conventional management and in conversion to organic farming were monitored throughout the three-year conversion phase to investigate the grapevine phytosanitary management of four major pests and diseases and variations in control efficiency. The severity of downy and powdery mildew, grape berry moths, and Botrytis bunch rot were assessed and linked to the protection strategy. The findings showed that pests and diseases were controlled in the third year of conversion at similar efficiency levels as in conventional farming. However, the first two years of conversion were a transitional and less successful period during which higher incidences of cryptogamic diseases were observed. This demonstrates a need for winegrowers to receive more in-depth technical advice and support, especially on pest and disease control, during this critical transition period.

In France, yield is often lower than winegrowers' objectives, and there is a need to understand the causes and magnitude of yield variability in vineyard systems. The yield formation process for grapevine (Vitis vinifera) takes place over two consecutive years. Grapevine is also characterised by a limited control of phenology, a winter dormancy period and the existence of storage organs. We adapted the regional agronomic diagnosis approach as defined by Dore et al. (1997) to quantify grapevine yield variability in two complementary case studies. The regional agronomic diagnosis proved useful in acquiring knowledge on grapevine functioning, reflecting on the data collection strategy, and leveraging interventions to better control yield by integrating multiple factors, particularly in the context of transitioning viticulture systems. Furthermore, the successful application of a regional agronomic diagnosis to grapevine crops can be considered as a major contribution to increasing the understanding of yield formation. It helps winegrowers manage yield variability when addressing planned or unplanned changing conditions, such as an agroecological transition or climate change.

Converting to organic farming requires numerous changes in pest and disease management, fertilization and weeding techniques. These changes can lead to difficulties in sustaining yields. Some studies have highlighted higher yields in conventional farming than in organic agriculture, but knowledge on yield dynamics during conversion is lacking. A set of 26 plots, under conventional management and in conversion to organic farming, were monitored from 2013 to 2016 in southern France throughout the three-year conversion phase to investigate the dynamics of grape yield and yield components. The survey showed that the yield and yield components remained similar levels as in conventional farming from the third year of conversion. However, the first two years of conversion were a transitional and less successful period during which yield and yield components decreased. Based on the in-depth analysis of the yield components, we have put forwards hypotheses on the processes at play and technical advice that could support winegrowers as they convert to organic farming.

Organic farming is presented as a way to limit the environmental impact of agriculture and produce healthier food. While studies often compare the performance of organic farming to that of conventional farming, there is a lack of knowledge on the conversion period. The present work explores the dynamics of practices employed during the conversion to organic farming and the impact of this transition on various compartments of the agrosystem. From 2013 to 2016, a regional agronomic diagnosis was performed on a network of 48 vineyard plots * year situations in southern France that are either under conventional management or are transitioning to organic farming. An inventory of practices was performed, and various indicators for the agrosystem status were monitored to investigate the changes that occur during the conversion to organic farming. The results of this study showed that the conversion involves a transitional period during which practices change and are adjusted from year to year. All the compartments of the agrosystem studied are impacted by these changes. Yield reductions observed in the first and second years of conversion could be related to the dynamics of pest and disease severity, decreases in nitrogen status and increases in water stress. Pest and disease control and soil management are key practices that must be mastered to limit the impact of conversion on production. This study shows that knowledge and in-depth support are needed before and during conversion to limit the impact of this transitional period and make the conversion successful.

How difficult this shift is depends on farms' biophysical and economic situations as well as on their specific dynamics. Methods to analyze, assess, and support transition strategies are needed. In this context, the hypothesis can be made that the efficiency-substitution-redesign approach, which is used for describing the level, intensity, and speed of changes made by vineyards, could be used to classify transition strategies. On-farm interviews and surveys were conducted at vineyards in conversion to organic farming in two French winegrowing regions: Languedoc and Bordeaux. The agronomic changes made to various grape production technical operations during the conversion period were described and assessed by using the efficiency-substitution-redesign approach. Potential economic consequences of conversion were measured by looking at farms' accounting records. Considering the high number of variables taken into account in the detailed analysis of each operation for the conversion to organic farming, the efficiency-substitution-redesign approach was successfully used to classify transition strategies according to the type of changes made. The results showed that change intensity varied between farms with no clear correlation between the type of changes and economic consequences. Farm trajectories were then correlated to the speed and intensity of changes with quantitative transition indicators. Here, a quantitative application of the efficiency-substitution-redesign approach was used for the first time to assess and classify organic farming conversion strategies according to a scale of change intensity and speed of changes. These results are essential to enhance understanding of what happens during conversion to organic farming and to better support winegrowers' trajectories.

Despite the key role of fine roots in carbon and nutrient cycling, root phenology is less well characterized than shoot phenology, due largely to methodological problems when measuring root systems at depths > 1.0 m. Fine root demography is also poorly related to the better established patterns of aboveground primary and secondary growth. We examined the influence of climatic factors on the dynamics of fine root elongation rate (RER), to a depth of 4.7 m, and assessed relationships with shoot phenology of walnut trees (Juglans nigra x J. regia) in a Mediterranean agroforestry system. Rhizotrons and minirhizotrons were installed for 21 months to monitor RER. Dendrometers were used to measure trunk and lateral root radial growth during the same period. Results showed that RER was not synchronous with budbreak and leaf unfolding (occurring from April to May) at any soil depth. However, during phase 2 of the growing season (June-November), daily RER in the upper soil (0.00-1.70 m) was synchronous with both trunk and lateral root radial growth, which were themselves positively correlated with the mean monthly soil and air temperatures and the mean monthly solar irradiance. Mean daily RER was not correlated to mean monthly soil and air temperatures at any soil depth during phase 2 of the growing season. However, during this period, mean daily RER of very shallow roots (0.00-0.85 m) was significantly and positively correlated with both mean monthly soil water content and solar irradiance. Maximal daily RER occurred during phase 2 of the growing season for the three upper soil layers (June-October), but peaked during the aerial dormant season (December) in the deepest soil layer (4.00-4.70 m). We conclude that drivers of phenology for different tree organs and between shallow and deep roots are not the same. This spatial plasticity in growth throughout a tree enables it to maximize resource uptake, even throughout the winter months, and thus is a highly useful mechanism for increasing tree resistance to abiotic stresses.

According to recent literature, two adaptation solutions based on the concept of diversification can be explored. The first solution is crop diversification at the field level. Three main cropping systems, namely agroforestry, intercropping, and service crops, have been shown to increase soil water availability and to improve crop water use. The second solution is to consider diversification at the landscape level by diversifying crops and associated agricultural management practices (in number, abundance, and spatial organization) and building small-scale water-harvesting infrastructures (WHI). In order to move toward a sustainable MA, one of the main scientific challenges ahead is to provide knowledge and tools, such as integrated agro-hydrological models, useful to evaluate several spatiotemporal combinations of these solutions in order to optimize soil water availability and crop water use.

Through a functional approach, the translation of cropping systems into resource and disturbance gradients is a promising way to decipher the relationship between cropping systems and biodiversity but has never been implemented for arthropods. To investigate the contributions of resource and disturbance gradients arising from cropping systems vs environmental context (regional effect, meteorological conditions and landscape characteristics) on beneficial arthropod communities, we used a dataset collected in 60 crop fields from three French areas over a 5-year period. It includes all farmer interventions, crop sequences, meteorological data, landscape composition and carabid samplings. We found that environmental context contributed to about 75% of explained carabid variations on average, while resource and disturbance gradients contributed to about 25% of explained carabid variations. The resource and disturbance gradients were particularly important in winter and in the spring preceding the spring-summer period to determine carabid variations. Moreover, we identified thresholds above which resource and disturbance gradients start being beneficial or detrimental for carabids. For example, increased treatment index in spring decreased the total activity density of carabids during the spring-summer period. Synthesis and applications. While implementing for the first time a functional approach to understand the effects of different facets of cropping systems on arthropods, our study also allows us to identify periods and thresholds above which specific practices affect carabids. Finally, avoiding bare soils all along the year, keeping pesticide use intensity below the identified thresholds and adopting a wide diversity of tillage strategies at the landscape scale should all contribute to enhance in-field carabid occurrences and richness.

In this paper, we consider the issue of selecting service plant species according to their potential to provide ecosystem services. To tackle that issue, we adopt an approach based both on a formalized representation of domain knowledge, which enables reasoning, and on the exploitation of available data, collected independently of the targeted application. More specifically, we rely on the one hand on recent scientific results in agronomy linking functional traits (i.e., measurable characteristics of plant species) to ecosystem services, and on the other hand on data about functional traits collected by the research community in ecology. The architecture of our system is inspired by the ontologybased data access paradigm, which allows to combine data and knowledge in a principled way. We provide a methodology to acquire scientific knowledge in the form of diagrams linked to data sources, as well as a formalization in a logical rule -based language. Importantly, our rules are independent from specific diagrams and data, to ensure genericity and facilitate the evolution of the system. We detail the construction of a knowledge base devoted to vine grassing, i.e., installing herbaceous service plants in vineyards, and present an evaluation of the system's results on this use case. We finally discuss the lessons learned and further challenges to be met.

Accordingly, the temporal variation of Sentinel-1 (S1) signal was analyzed as a function of the phenological phases' dates observed in situ (germination; heading and soft dough), and harvesting. Results showed that S1 data, unlike the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, were able to estimate the dates of theses phenological phases due to significant variations in S1 temporal series at the dates of germination, heading, soft dough, and harvesting. Particularly, the ratio VV/VH at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees) was able to detect the germination and harvesting dates. VV polarization at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees) was able to detect the heading phase, while VH polarization at high incidence angle (43-45 degrees) was better than that at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees), in detecting the soft dough phase. An automated approach for main wheat phenological phases' determination was then developed on the western part of the Bekaa plain. This approach modelled the S1 SAR temporal series by smoothing and fitting the temporal series with Gaussian functions (up to three Gaussians) allowing thus to automatically detect the main wheat phenological phases from the sum of these Gaussians. To test its robustness, the automated method was applied on the northern part of the Bekaa plain, in which winter wheat is harvested usually earlier because of the different weather conditions. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the estimation of the phenological phases' dates was 2.9 days for germination, 5.5 days for heading, 5.1 days soft dough, 3.0 days for West Bekaa's harvesting, and 4.5 days for North Bekaa's harvesting. In addition, a slight underestimation was observed for germination and heading of West Bekaa (-0.2 and -1.1 days, respectively) while an overestimation was observed for soft dough of West Bekaa and harvesting for both West and North Bekaa (3.1, 0.6, and 3.6 days, respectively). These results are encouraging, and thus prove that S1 data are powerful as a tool for crop monitoring, to serve enhanced crop management and production handling."

Considering the delicate economic situation of farmers in the Mediterranean area, recommending a low risk, sustainable farming system is desirable. In this study, an innovative application of a multi-criteria field-level approach is presented, targeting food security, farmer profitability and environmental sustainability. The CropSyst biophysical simulation model was calibrated and implemented for the study site. It was chosen for its agro-environmental robustness to simulate four rotations (wheat-wheat, wheat-fallow, wheat-potato, and wheat-fava bean). Four types of wheat agricultural management systems (full fertilization and full irrigation, full fertilization and zero irrigation, zero fertilization and full irrigation, and zero fertilization and irrigation) were tested in low and high soil water holding capacity (WHC) types. The effects of soil conditions, management practices and rotation type on wheat grain yields were assessed. Furthermore, the performance of each winter wheat-based cropping system was evaluated in terms of productivity (protein production and profitability) and the efficient use of resources (nitrogen and water), as well as the economic risk of low relative productivity each one engenders. The results show that there is no particular optimal scenario that can simultaneously ensure high productivity, reduce economic risk of low relative productivity, and achieve high wheat- water- and nitrogen-use efficiency. However, the wheat-fava bean rotation cultivated with no wheat fertilization appeared to be a better substitute to the wheatwheat rotation in terms of protein production (0.93 t/ha versus 0.8 t/ha in low WHC soil and 1.34 t/ha versus 1.17 t/ha in high WHC). This cropping system achieved a higher net profit (2111 US$/ha versus 1222US$/ha in low WHC and 3550 US$/ha versus 2450 US$/ha in high WHC), showing high resource-use efficiency and was less risky for farmers. Moreover, a very high profit could only be attained with the wheat-potato rotation (8640 US$/ha and 12,170 US$/ha in low and high WHC, respectively), yet with low input-efficiency and high economic risk of low relative productivity.

Models are pertinent tools to quantitatively explore possible futures, and participatory approaches help account for local diversity. We developed a model through an approach that involves stakeholders in the model's construction and testing and in the discussion of results. We simulated spatially explicit impacts of climate change on water balance, grape phenology, and yield in a Mediterranean vineyard watershed for two climate scenarios. Results show a decrease in grape production of 7-14% by 2100. Yield decrease would be higher in irrigated high-yield areas despite a doubling of irrigation water supply. A forecasted 6 degrees C increase in temperature during berry ripening would threaten wine quality. The approach allows the communication of model results and limitations to stakeholders. It is a promising means of identifying potential local adaptations to climate change.

While rigorous evaluations of adaptation strategies provide decision makers with valuable insights, those that are published often overlook major constraints, ignore local adaptive capacity, and suffer from a compartmentalization of disciplines and scales. The objective of our study was to identify current knowledge of evaluation methods and their limitations, reported in the literature. We reviewed 111 papers that evaluate adaptation strategies in the main vineyards worldwide. Evaluation approaches are analyzed through key features (e.g., climate data sources, methodology, evaluation criteria) to discuss their ability to address climate change issues, and to identify promising outcomes for climate change adaptations. We highlight the fact that combining adaptation levers in the short and long term (location, vine training, irrigation, soil, and canopy management, etc.) enables local compromises to be reached between future water availability and grapevine productivity. The main findings of the paper are three-fold: (1) the evaluation of a combination of adaptation strategies provides better solutions for adapting to climate change; (2) multi-scale studies allow local constraints and opportunities to be considered; and (3) only a small number of studies have developed multi-scale and multi-lever approaches to quantify feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation. In addition, we found that climate data sources were not systematically clearly presented, and that climate uncertainty was hardly accounted for. Moreover, only a small number of studies have assessed the economic impacts of adaptation, especially at farm scale. We conclude that the development of methodologies to evaluate adaptation strategies, considering both complementary adaptations and scales, is essential if relevant information is to be provided to the decision-makers of the wine industry."

This diversity needs to be considered when designing and assessing adaptation strategies to co-ordinate better with these diverse local conditions.Objective: We developed a participatory modeling approach to (1) design adaptation strategies in a viticultural watershed in southern France, (2) numerically and spatially evaluate their effects under future climatic condi-tions, and (3) discuss the results with stakeholders.Methods: We organized two sets of collective workshops, before and after a simulation phase. During the workshops, we designed four adaptation strategies that correspond to different ways to combine adaptation measures proposed by stakeholders. A spatially explicit model was used to evaluate the effects of six adaptation measures (late varieties, irrigation, reducing canopy size, adjusting cover cropping, reducing density, and shading) at field scale and combinations of them at watershed scale. Simulations were realized under a high emissions climate change scenario RCP 8.5. Model-based evaluations were followed by discussions with stake-holders. The cost-effectiveness of adaptation strategies was estimated at farm scale using an indicator designed by the stakeholders. Results and conclusions: The spatial combination of adaptation measures in a viticultural watershed provided options for adapting wine growing systems to climate change. A delayed harvest strategy with currently available late varieties provided only minimal relief from high temperature during ripening. A water stress limitation strategy would compensate for production losses if disruptive adaptations (e.g., reduced density) were adopted and if more vineyards were irrigated. A relocation strategy would encourage premium wine production in the constrained mountainous areas, where grapevines systems are historically adapted to limited water conditions. A soil improvement strategy was mentioned but not evaluated in the model due to scarce data and literature on the possible improvement of soil water holding capacity.Significance: The sharing of knowledge between researchers, technical experts, and wine growers enabled the construction of a common understanding of the local impacts and adaptation potential to climate change in the watershed. In further research, this knowledge could help decision makers to define pathways for adaptive ac-tions at farm scale.

The DEPHY network is one such initiative;, which has been designed to drive, support and document the fieldwork of 3,000 farms voluntarily taking part in a collective input reduction programme. This study aimed to describe the achievements of the network's viticultural sector, as its perennial crop is heavily reliant on pesticide applications. We chose a sample of 343 wine-growing systems across mainland France, analysed records of their vineyard operations from before they joined the network, and compared them to those from the 2017-2020 period. We used the Treatment Frequency Index (TFI) to assess pesticide reliance together with other techno-economical parameters: production costs, workloads, greenhouse gas emissions and disease control. A significant decrease in pesticide use was found over the whole study period, with, for instance, an average TFI reduction of 24 %, which is consistent with national objectives but unmatched outside of the network. We observed an overall shift towards pesticide inputs with lower repercussions on health or the environment, as well as different TFI reduction trajectories based on initial pesticide dependency. We described the alternative practices introduced to the systems, and our results suggest that reductions in pesticide use stem from quite small and minor changes made to the cropping systems. These new practices only slightly lowered the vineyards' technical and economical performances in specific situations involving an indepth revamping of the systems; e.g., conversion to organic viticulture. To increase pesticide phase-out, further research is needed on redesigning cropping systems, and on how to scale up the network's results to the national level."

The peach tree has an unusual vegetative growth pattern when cultivated in a tropical area, which occurs in two flushes, with the first flush occurring from budbreak to fruit harvest between June and Sept, forming short shoots (less than 10 cm), with early shoot growth cessation, with a limited leaf number that can potentially diminish the supply of carbohydrates to the fruit, leading to smaller growth. The second flush occurs after harvest, between Oct and Dec, when there is an increase in daily temperature and precipitation, and no competition with fruits. Notabily, these second flush shoots grow with greater vigor and regularization of the growth cycle, forming fruit-bearing shoots with abundant leaf and flower buds for the next production cycle."

An 8-year experiment was conducted on grapevine in two zones of a vineyard (1 ha) differentiated according to grapevine vigour as determined by NDVI: high vigour (HV) and low vigour (LV). The heterogeneity of the soil properties (depth, texture and composition), plant growth (shoots and roots) and plant production (yield components and berry composition) were determined at plot level. Compared to the LV zone, the HV zone was associated with deeper soils, higher soil water and nitrogen availability, CEC and montmorillonite/illite ratio. More extended root systems, higher vegetative growth and higher yield were observed in the HV zone compared to the LV zone. Drier and warmer vintages increased the difference in heterogeneity of vine growth and yield between the two zones. Berry composition (primary and secondary metabolites) also differed between HV and LV zones but seemed unconnected to vigour and mainly depended on soil-climate-plant interactions over the years. The heterogeneity of plant vigour within the vineyard mainly resulted from differences in root exploration, soil profile and composition (notably montmorillonite/illite ratio). The present study identified soil and crop factors that, depending on weather conditions, can be drivers for reducing the heterogeneity of plant development and improving productivity at vineyard level.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of soil and plant management (site-specific management) to increase yields and improve berry quality. During three consecutive seasons, contrasting treatments designed ad hoc for two zones of vigour pre-established by NDVI were tested: high vigour zone (HV) and low vigour zone (LV). The treatments were aimed at reducing water and nitrogen supply and improving microclimatic conditions in the cluster zone in the HV zone. In the LV zone, treatments were aimed at increasing water and nitrogen supply. Leaf removal in the HV zone was the most efficient treatment to improve productivity and quality. Moreover, the water restriction improved grape quality, especially in a rainy year. The regulated deficit irrigation strategy applied in the LV zone at specific phenological stages was shown to increase vegetative growth, yield and to improve grape anthocyanins and phenols contents. The benefits of additional nitrogen supply in the LV zone on plant nitrogen status, yield, and berry composition were highly dependent on water availability. Ultimately, this study provided new insights into the relationship between water and nitrogen availability and how this determines vigour and influences yield and grape quality and influences the deviation from a ""Productive Target"" pattern. The use of site-specific techniques could be adjusted on a small production scale, thanks to mapping carried out with precision viticulture technologies."

While methods to reduce this use have been proposed by researchers, they have not yet been widely implemented by winegrowers. Involving winegrowers in the participatory design of new management strategies could encourage the adoption of these methods to reduce pesticide use. In this study, we designed and tested a participatory approach to reducing pesticide use that would be acceptable to winegrowers from a South -Western cooperative (i.e., not 'pioneering' winegrowers). The approach was composed of three main steps: A) co -design of the management strategies, B) implementation of the management strategies, and C) co -evaluation of the performances of the implemented management strategies. Winegrowers, researchers, advisors and engineers were involved in the study. The application of this participatory approach enabled the co -design and testing of two management strategies: IPM for Integrated Pest Management [50% reduction of pesticide treatment frequency index (TFI) as compared to the French High Environmental Value reference (HEV)], and ORG2kgCo for organic farming system with a maximum of 2 kg of copper/ha/year. These two management strategies were implemented by 11 winegrowers in three vineyards in SouthWestern France. In both management strategies, two main technical levers were selected to reduce pesticide use: a Decision Support System to optimise the use and substitution of pesticides by biocontrol products. The implementation of the IPM management strategy resulted in a significant reduction of TFI (from -14% to -57%, with an average of -25%, for all pesticides combined) compared to HEV, and the winegrowers who tested ORG2kgCo managed to not exceed the limit of 2 kg of copper per year. This original participatory approach, combining co -design workshops, on -farm experimentation and co -evaluation workshops, highlighted the benefits of involving winegrowers in the reduction of pesticide use.

When there is insufficient chilling accumulation during the cold season, apple trees present erratic and poor budbreak. However, there is a lack of information regarding carbohydrate metabolism and their influence on budbreak and branch architecture in apples grown in subtropical humid climates. This work aimed to evaluate budbreak and the availability of carbohydrates in distal and proximal portions of 1-year-old apple tree shoots, and to verify their relationships with axillary shoot formation in spring. Two apple cultivars 'Eva' and 'Fuji', with low and high chilling requirements, respectively, were assessed in a mild winter region of Brazil. From April to October of 2012, 2013 and 2014, 25 one-year-old shoots of each cultivar were sampled bi-weekly. These shoots were divided into distal and proximal portions. Wood from five shoots was sampled to quantify the nonstructural carbohydrate and alpha-amylase content for each portion. The single-node cutting test was used to observe mean time to budburst for the remaining 20 shoots. In generally, our results suggest that under mild winter conditions, the apple tree does not enter into deep endodormancy. Furthermore, there were biological and biochemical differences between the distal and proximal portions of the bearing-shoots for all the studied variables, likely related to the higher sink force in the distal portion. Consequently, the buds from the distal portion sprout first, thereby establishing a primigenic dominance over the buds of the proximal portion. Our study also suggests that the shallow endodormancy of high chilling requirement cultivars cultivated in mild winter regions would make paradormancy predominant, emphasizing acrotonic branching in these cultivars. There was greater availability of nonstructural carbohydrates and alpha-amylase activity in the wood of the distal portion of 1-year-bearing shoots of apple trees under mild winter conditions, regardless of the cultivar.

Although recent research has produced a number of ecological and social principles that should form the basis of agricultural landscape design process, implementation is still in its infancy. One difficulty is the context-dependency of ecological responses and the resulting limiting capacity to predict the benefits of landscape transformation for the targeted organisms or services. In addition, there is a poor understanding of the obstacles to and levers for the implementation of collective management at the landscape scale. In this paper, we argue that Landscape Monitoring Networks (LMN), i.e. long-term and standardized monitoring of ecological and managerial processes within a set of replicated regional landscapes, can contribute to tackling these issues. We first present the current challenges in designing agroecological landscapes before outlining the principles of LMN and how these research facilities could help deliver ecological and social understanding along a gradient from place-based to generic knowledge. We then discuss critical issues that need to be solved to ensure that LMN delivers relevant knowledge for landscape design. We illustrate this through the experience of an ongoing LMN that was created in France in 2014 to address biodiversity and pest control services in agricultural landscapes.

Our study focused on the expression of shade adaptation traits of apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh. 'Dalinette') in an agroforestry system. METHODS The architecture of 45 apple trees in their third and fourth year was extensively described and analyzed at the tree scale and compared depending on the light quantity received during the growing season. Flower cluster phenology and the relation between leaf area and floral initiation were also investigated. RESULTS The number of growing shoots and the leaf area were reduced by shade even if specific leaf area increased with increasing shade. Shade did not modify primary growth but did decrease secondary growth, so that apple tree shoots in shade were slender, with a lower taper and reduced number and proportion of flower clusters. The correlation between floral initiation and leaf area was high both in full and moderate light but not for apple trees in low light. Shade did not impact the date of bud burst and the early phenological stages of flower clusters, but it reduced the number of days at full bloom. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that while the architecture of apple trees is modified by a reduction in light intensity, it is not until a reduction of 65% that the capability to produce fruit is impeded. These results could help optimize the design of apple-tree-based agroforestry systems.

However, this was achieved at the cost of an increasing dependence on external inputs such as water, fertilizers and pesticides. This dependence is now questioned because of the generated environmental pollution and health issues. Different solutions have been considered to reduce this dependence including more efficient practices that improve resilience of agricultural systems to external pressures (climatic disturbances, new diseases, economic crises). To reduce pest and disease pressure, to improve resources use and to buffer extreme climatic events, agroforestry systems (AFS), i.e., the association, in one field, of tailored perennial and annual crops and possibly animals, are proposed as a way to use positive interactions between various plants. In temperate climate, AFS associate a tree stratum and a (or several) crop stratum, e.g., fruit trees and vegetables. An original AFS located in southeastern France, characterized by a Mediterranean climate and composed of mature walnut grown for timber, apple trees in an intermediate vertical stratum, and alfalfa at the lowest stratum, is being used to study the impact of an AFS on apple trees. Comparing apple trees in the AFS and in full sun, we first showed a significant effect of walnuts on the below-canopy microclimate reducing incoming global radiation and acting as a buffer on temperatures surrounding the apple trees. Secondly, AFS significantly altered the apple tree stem geometry (lesser tapering), growth dynamics (more growth cessation) and morphology (higher individual leaf area and specific leaf area). Results will be discussed with regard to the putative long-term effects of agroforestry conditions on the apple tree architecture and fruiting.

";10.1007/s13593-022-00855-8;;WOS:000911933800002;;;;;;;;;In response to the sustainability issues that agriculture faces in advanced economies, agroecology has gained increasing relevance in scientific, political, and social debates. This has promoted discussion about transitions to agroecology, which represents a significant advancement. Accordingly, it has become a growing field of research. We reviewed the literature on and in support of farm transitions to agroecology in advanced economies in order to identify key research challenges and suggest innovative research paths. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Research that supports exploration and definition of desired futures, whether based on future-oriented modeling or expert-based foresight approaches, should more explicitly include the farm level. It should stimulate the creativity and design ability of farmers and other stakeholders, and also address issues of representation and power among them. (2) Research that creates awareness and assesses farms before, during or after transition requires more holistic and dynamic assessment frameworks. These frameworks need to be more flexible to adapt to the diversity of global and local challenges. Their assessment should explicitly include uncertainty due to the feedback loops and emergent properties of transitions. (3) Research that analyzes and supports farms during transition should focus more on the dynamics of change processes by valuing what happens on the farms. Research should especially give more credence to on-farm experiments conducted by farmers and develop new tools and methods (e.g., for strategic monitoring) to support these transitions. This is the first review of scientific studies of farm transitions to agroecology. Overall, the review indicates that these transitions challenge the system boundaries, temporal horizons, and sustainability dimensions that agricultural researchers usually consider. In this context, farm transitions to agroecology require changes in the current organization and funding of research in order to encourage longer term and more adaptive configurations.

However, compared with conventional viticulture, it has shown higher interannual variability in its environmental impacts. Improved understanding of this variability would help organic winegrowers better address their environmental impacts. Methods This two-part study examined interannual variability of environmental impacts of four vineyards with contrasting pedoclimatic and technical production conditions. First, life cycle assessments were performed on each of these four vineyards for two contrasted years in terms of both climate and pest and disease pressure. Next, for one of these vineyards located in Mediterranean conditions, life cycle assessments were completed on a chronosequence of six consecutive years. Life cycle assessments of organic wine grapes were calculated based on detailed inventories of data from the eight real vineyard situations. Interannual variations were considered to be the deviation between the impact results of two production years. Results and discussion In all the vineyards, diesel combustion was the main impact contributor. For the four vineyards, the impacts that varied most were generally freshwater ecotoxicity, soil ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, freshwater eutrophication and metal depletion. The intensity/range of interannual variations differed between plots. The main agricultural operations contributing to impact variations were from disease management of climate-related disease pressures. The 6-year chronosequence analysis showed that certain years were very similar in terms of impact results. The impact that varied most was surprisingly terrestrial acidification. The chronosequence analysis brought to light that the choice of active ingredient could be a greater source of impact variations than interannual climatic conditions and disease pressure. Conclusions This study provides an overview of the hotspots and variability of organic viticulture environmental impacts in contrasted climate years and a climatic chronosequence. The main pathways for environmental performance improvements are (i) reducing fuel consumption by either limiting the number of operations, using more fuel-efficient machines or different energy sources or/and adjusting tractor speed; (ii) reducing the doses and emissions of copper products and choosing the less impacting types of copper; and (iii) limiting nitrogen and heavy metal emissions through the choice of fertiliser type and management."

Organic viticulture is often seen as a sustainable system but has also environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is able to discriminate vineyard managements. Aims: Our study explores the interest of LCA to assess, compare and improve organic vineyard management routes through a comparison of information given by practices inventories, Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs) and LCA. LCA methodological challenges are also discussed. Material and methods: Eight cases were studied in three French wine regions and two years. LCI and Life Cycle Impact Assessments (LCIAs) were calculated, five impacts were selected by correlation (climate change, fresh water eutrophication, terrestrial ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification, marine eutrophication). Results and discussion: Practices and quantity of inputs were contrasted among the cases. The study of impacts on climate change revealed the hierarchy of importance of operations and a different ranking of cases for the functional units Ha and Kg. The LCIAs showed major differences between cases for some impacts and their drivers. LCIA and LCI permitted to account for the life cycle dimension of the impacts and for the toxicity and persistence of pesticides. The challenges of organic vineyard LCA are to (i) better consider sulphur and copper, (ii) enrich databases on organic fertilizer, and (iii) build an LCA indicator of biodiversity impact. Conclusion: LCA is better than practices inventories and LCI to assess organic viticulture.

This study analyzed the CC mitigation potential of an alley cropping system on crop physiological stresses and growth as compared to a monoculture system. Materials and Methods: Growth of winter durum wheat, cultivated alone (agriculture) and in combination with hybrid walnut (agroforestry), was simulated with the Hi-sAFe agroforestry model, as driven by business-as-usual Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections, split into three scenarios, representing Past (1951-1990), Present (1991-2030), and Future (2031-2070) climatic conditions. Crop growth and the occurrence of thermal, nitrogen, and water stresses were analyzed. Results: Cold-related stresses were modest in Past and almost disappeared over time. Heat, drought, and nitrogen stresses increased about twofold from Past to Future, but were reduced by 20-35% in agroforestry, already with medium-sized trees (diameter at breast height (DBH) of about 10-15 cm). Crop yields in agriculture increased from Past to the end of Present and then remained stable. This moderately decreased with tree age in agroforestry (especially in Future). Discussion: The impact of CC on the crop was buffered in agroforestry, especially for the most extreme climatic events. The mitigation of crop microclimate and the increased stability of crop yields highlight the potential of agroforestry as a CC adaptation strategy.

The ALTO project is a multi-actor research project based on new fruit production concepts. Three diversified orchards in three sites of Southern France were designed following the same objectives of ecological intensification and production in very low or pesticide-free systems. Agronomic, ecological and organizational aspects were involved in the co-design approach. The first system is a newly planted circular orchard with a pest suppressive design. The second is an orchard, with previous agroecological infrastructures and fruit trees, that has evolved "" step by step"" into a diversified production area. The third site investigates the effects of spatial arrangement of an agroforestry apple agrosystem on tree architecture and functioning. The design and the evaluation of these experimental systems address three main questions, shared by one, two or all sites: 1) Can crop and non-crop diversification, as well as spatial arrangement, limit fruit damage caused by pests? 2) Can crop design, more specifically agroforestry, impacts abiotic resource sharing between crops? 3) How growing fruit-trees in these diversified systems impact workload and organization? Although this research is in progress and requires multiyear data, the first results provide feedback on the effectiveness of pest suppressive strategies (trap plants and low-susceptibility cultivars, barrier effects, flower strips and diversified surrounding landscape to favor natural enemies of pests, etc.), as well as on resource sharing for light, and on flowering. Tradeoffs between agronomic, ecological and organizational aspects are also investigated. Besides, the experimental prototypes are likely to evolve with time integrating further exchanges with stakeholders and lessons from on-going management. Multicriteria evaluation of these experimented multi-production prototypes is still in progress but the present analysis opens avenues for agroecological design in perennial crops."

This is particularly true in low-input rice-based cropping systems in the Malagasy highlands, where weed management is mainly done by manual removal. Crop rotation is often promoted as an efficient way to control weed infestations, while the role of fertilization is more controversial. In this study, we compared rice monoculture to three rainfed rice-based two-year rotations: rice followed by groundnut, rice followed by sorghum-cowpea mixture, and rice followed by a velvet-bean crotalaria mixture. Each rotation was tested with two levels of fertilization (5 t DM ha(-1) organic manure, sole or in combination with mineral fertilizer - 400 kg ha(-1) NPK + 200 kg ha(-1) urea). We assessed the effect of rotation and fertilization on weed composition, diversity, biomass and rice yield. Additionally, the farmers' perception of weed harmfulness and the relation between their assessment of weed harmfulness and rice production was tested. Our results showed that weed biomass significantly decreased rice yield but only under the low fertilization level. The rotation of rice with the velvet beancrotalaria mixture was efficient in reducing weed biomass, modified weed community composition and allowed to achieve the highest rice yield. A significant negative relationship was found between weed community harmfulness index and weed species richness. Yet, the lowest rice yield was observed under rice monoculture despite a higher species richness over years and under high fertilization level. The lack of significant correlation between the harmfulness index and the actual rice yield is probably because our index is partly based on farmer's perception, and only on major weeds. More studies on tropical weed harmfulness are needed to support the design of ecologically intensified cropping systems.

An empirical approach was introduced in 2008 based on the extrapolation across a domain (vineyard block, vineyard, region) of vine water status observations from a reference site using a simple statistical model, called SPIDER, and proved efficient in many studies. Once the extrapolation model is calibrated, this approach leads to a concentration of measurements for one site only (reference site) while providing an estimate of the grapevine water status at a larger spatial scale. It is a promising hybrid approach based both on regular (but targeted) measurements and on modelling. However, so far only empirical guidelines for its practical use have been provided. Moreover, the limits of validity (spatial, temporal, etc.) of such an approach are not known. This work intends to use a mechanistic model based on grapevine water balance modelling to study to what extent a simulated water status can be spatially extrapolated at the field scale. The water balance model was calibrated on two datasets (different cultivars and weather data) and used to analyse the performances of SPIDER. The results confirmed the relevance of the empirical approach (SPIDER) based on water status spatial extrapolation with a low error level on the two datasets studied. The use of the water balance model also helped define the validity domain of SPIDER: it confirmed the importance of having dominantly dry conditions and revealed the possibility of recovering good prediction quality after strong rainfall or irrigation. This study globally demonstrates the relevance of spatial extrapolation of the vine water status from a reference site with a linear regression model and provides new insights on the properties of the predictions for application in viticulture either at the within-field level or at larger scale.

The transition to providing multiple services within an agroecosystem is a starting point for heightened multifunctionality, however, there is still hesitation among stakeholders about moving towards multi-service systems, largely because of the lack of knowledge linking productivity and multifunctionality. We reason that much of this reticence could be overcome through a better understanding of stakeholder re-quirements and innovative transdisciplinary research extended in the dimensions of time and space. We assembled experts in France to identify priority research questions for co-constructing projects with stakeholders. We identified 18 key questions, as well as the obstacles that hinder their resolution and propose potential so-lutions for tackling these obstacles. We illustrate that research into agroecosystem multifunctionality and service production must be a hugely collaborative effort and needs to integrate knowledge from different sectors and communities. Promoting dialogue, standardization and data-sharing would enhance transdisciplinary progress. Biodiversity is highlighted as a key factor to explore and incorporate into modelling approaches, but major advances must be made in the understanding of dynamic changes in the biodiversity-function-service nexus across landscapes. Resolving these research questions will allow us to translate knowledge into decision objec-tives, identify adaptation and tipping points in agroecosystems and develop social-ecological economic pathways that are adaptive over time.

Although trees compete with crops for soil resources in agroforestry,they can also improve crops' growing conditions, especially, by providing shade under drought. They can promote higher crop yields and higher harvest quality in the drylands. However, the beneficial effect of tree shade may depend on the seasonal pattern of rainfall, which determines the compensation between yield components. In this study, we evaluated two annual crops (durum wheat and faba bean) in olive agroforestry in northern Morocco. We manipulated water supply in a field experiment to span the high inter-annual rainfall variability at the site and tested whether olive trees reduce or improve crop yields. We assessed the effect of water addition on crop growth, yield components, and final yields and estimated the land equivalent ratio of olive agroforestry. Agroforestry limited crop growth and yield whatever the water regime. The magnitude of grain yield reduction was around 50 % for both crops in 2018, probably due to shade. The number of grains per unit area was the most impacted yield component in both 2018 and 2019. In contrast, water addition only had limited effects on faba bean yield, although it enhanced wheat grain yield by 11 % and the number of wheat spikes by 13 %. Agroforestry improved individual grain weight by 39 % for wheat and 17 % for faba bean, and enhanced the protein content of wheat grains and straw by 4 % and 9 %. However, improvements in grain weight and in protein content were not sufficient to compensate for yield loss due to shade. Despite lower crop yields, we show that agroforestry systems are still more land productive than sole crops and trees, even under arid conditions. We show how changing water supply may impact the performance of olive agroforestry in a drier future.

The process of digitalization offers significant opportunities to enhance sustainability, but it remains crucial to foster a human-centric, fair, and sustainable approach. In the context of the DigitAF Horizon Europe project, we present the results of a multi-stakeholder questionnaire aimed at understanding the perceptions of stakeholders regarding agroforestry and digitalization, as well as the needs of these stakeholders for a successful implementation of this agricultural practice. In the questionnaire, there was a specific focus on the need for and the conditions for the use of digital tools and models, such as generalized digital tools, applications and mapping, climate and weather forecasting and recording, farm management and decision support, and agroforestry and environmental tools. The purpose of this survey was to provide insights to inform agroforestry actors and to foster collaborative initiatives that enhance the potential of digital tools to support the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective and sustainable agroforestry in the European context. Our questionnaire was completed by stakeholders from seven European countries, including farmers, academics, policy actors, farm advisors, and actors in the value chain with an interest in agroforestry. Stakeholders from six living labs, representing Czechia, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK, were involved in the appraisal, along with a multi-stakeholder group from Belgium. Respondents used data and digital tools for various purposes in farming systems and were interested in their potential to improve agroforestry including animal, tree, and crop performance, management guidance, system design, and tree species selection. Our survey revealed that the perceived usefulness of digital tools for agroforestry was substantially higher than stakeholders' awareness of existing tools, indicating a need for better promotion and development of user-friendly, accessible solutions. Additionally, significant obstacles to agroforestry adoption, such as large up-front investments, administrative burdens, and fear of reduced CAP support, were identified, emphasizing the necessity for targeted support and policy improvements. Moving forward, efforts should focus on developing targeted solutions to promote agroforestry according to stakeholder perception, and user-friendly digital tools tailored to the needs and preferences expressed by stakeholders, while also increasing knowledge sharing and capacity building among practitioners and researchers.

Agriculture is currently the largest user of water, but its share is bound to decrease as societies develop and clearly it needs to become more water efficient. Improving water use efficiency (WUE) at the plant level is important, but translating this at the farm/landscape level presents considerable challenges. As we move up from the scale of cells, organs, and plants to more integrated scales such as plots, fields, farm systems, and landscapes, other factors such as trade-offs need to be considered to try to improve WUE. These include choices of crop variety/species, farm management practices, landscape design, infrastructure development, and ecosystem functions, where human decisions matter. This review is a cross-disciplinary attempt to analyse approaches to addressing WUE at these different scales, including definitions of the metrics of analysis and consideration of trade-offs. The equations we present in this perspectives paper use similar metrics across scales to make them easier to connect and are developed to highlight which levers, at different scales, can improve WUE. We also refer to models operating at these different scales to assess WUE. While our entry point is plants and crops, we scale up the analysis of WUE to farm systems and landscapes. This review considers approaches to improving water use efficiency beyond the whole-plant level, across scales of time and space, from cells, organs, and plants, to fields, farms, and landscapes.

Weeds not only compete with crops for resources but also pose threats to food safety and agricultural sustainability through the indiscriminate use of herbicides, which can lead to environmental contamination and herbicide-resistant weed populations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a paradigm shift in agriculture, particularly in the domain of weed management. AI's utilization in this domain extends beyond mere innovation, offering precise and eco-friendly solutions for the identification and control of weeds, thereby addressing critical agricultural challenges. This article aims to examine the application of AI in weed management in the context of weed detection and the increasing impact of deep learning techniques in the agricultural sector. Through an assessment of research articles, this study identifies critical factors influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in weed management. These criteria encompass factors of AI adoption (food safety, increased effectiveness, and eco-friendliness through herbicides reduction), AI implementation factors (capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and outcomes and accuracy), ancillary technologies (IoT, UAV, field robots, and herbicides), and the related impact of AI methods adoption (economic, social, technological, and environmental). Of the 5821 documents found, 99 full-text articles were assessed, and 68 were included in this study. The review highlights AI's role in enhancing food safety by reducing herbicide residues, increasing effectiveness in weed control strategies, and promoting ecofriendliness through judicious herbicide use. It underscores the importance of capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and accuracy metrics in AI implementation, emphasizing their synergy in revolutionizing weed management practices. Ancillary technologies, such as IoT, UAVs, field robots, and AI-enhanced herbicides, complement AI's capabilities, offering holistic and data-driven approaches to weed control. Additionally, the adoption of AI methods influences economic, social, technological, and environmental dimensions of agriculture. Last but not least, digital literacy emerges as a crucial enabler, empowering stakeholders to navigate AI technologies effectively and contribute to the sustainable transformation of weed management practices in agriculture.

However, the timing and frequency of such events are impacted by climate change, jeopardizing plant survival. Understanding better the strategies of survival to dehydration stress is therefore timely and can be enhanced by the cross-fertilization of research between disciplines (ecology, physiology), models (woody, herbaceous species) and types of stress (drought, frost). Scope We build upon the 'growth-stress survival' trade-off, which underpins the identification of global plant strategies across environments along a 'fast-slow' economics spectrum. Although phenological adaptations such as dormancy are crucial to survive stress, plant global strategies along the fast-slow economic spectrum rarely integrate growth variations across seasons. We argue that the growth-stress survival trade-off can be a useful framework to identify convergent plant ecophysiological strategies to survive both frost and drought. We review evidence that reduced physiological activity, embolism resistance and dehydration tolerance of meristematic tissues are interdependent strategies that determine thresholds of mortality among plants under severe frost and drought. We show that complete dormancy, i.e. programmed growth cessation, before stress occurrence, minimizes water flows and maximizes dehydration tolerance during seasonal life-threatening stresses. We propose that incomplete dormancy, i.e. the programmed reduction of growth potential during the harshest seasons, could be an overlooked but major adaptation across plants. Quantifying stress survival in a range of non-dormant versus winter- or summer-dormant plants, should reveal to what extent incomplete to complete dormancy could represent a proxy for dehydration tolerance and stress survival. Conclusions Our review of the strategies involved in dehydration stress survival suggests that winter and summer dormancy are insufficiently acknowledged as plant ecological strategies. Incorporating a seasonal fast-slow economics spectrum into global plant strategies improves our understanding of plant resilience to seasonal stress and refines our prevision of plant adaptation to extreme climatic events.

In many of these landscapes, coordinated action among stakeholders at landscape level would help to address challenges such as pests and diseases, price crises and climate change. However, methods to facilitate the co-production of sustainable landscape management in such complex multi-stakeholder systems are currently largely lacking. In this paper, we present a novel approach to explore pathways for the sustainability transition of agroforestry systems. By combining participatory forecasting and backcasting approaches, based on serious games and future vision development, we explore relevant agroforestry management strategies for reaching sustainable future coffee-based agroforestry landscapes. We focused our research on the challenges faced in the main coffee-producing area in Nicaragua. Here, we organized five participatory game sessions to explore farmer decision-making processes, farming strategies and to develop new networks and stimulate social learning among farmers. In the associated backcasting workshop, the most influential game session participants joined technicians, researchers and municipality officials to collectively envision sustainable future landscape management. In all game sessions, farmers developed diversified coffee-based agroforested landscapes characterised by increased density and diversity of shade trees, for the purpose of income diversification as well as forest conservation. During the backcasting workshop, the participants identified policy instruments and community-based solutions for the transition to sustainable landscapes. Our participatory approach facilitated discussion on landscape planning among farmers and other stakeholders and allowed the outline of a pathway towards the collective envisioned future landscape. The combination of participatory forecasting and backcasting proved to be a helpful tool to support multi-stakeholder processes towards sustainable landscape management in this and other complex landscapes.

Yet the emergent herbaceous communities in these organic systems remain understudied, with the functional diversity and management of this stratum relatively unknown. This study identifies the taxonomic and functional diversity of the herbaceous community in organic coffee agroforestry systems, and describes the extent of this diversity with farm, and farmer, attributes. We measured leaf-level functional traits (e.g. specific leaf area) of the herbaceous community to derive functional diversity indices and collected localized environmental conditions on 15 organic coffee farms in Central Valley, Costa Rica. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with nine farmers to construct mental models on herbaceous community management using a cognitive mapping approach. In total, 38 species from 20 taxonomic families were present in these organic coffee systems. The herbaceous communities were functionally diverse; however, functional evenness increased with canopy openness, suggesting that farms adopting agroforestry tend to have a more functionally diverse herbaceous stratum. Farmer perception of plant traits in the herbaceous community was differentiated into competitive (weeds) or neutral/positive effects. These perceptions aligned with well-established functional trait trade-offs. The mental models representing farmer decision-making processes were highly variable, with a nearly 30% increase in cognitive map density from the simplest map to the most complex; this complexity in mental models was a key explanatory variable in the level of functional diversity of the herbaceous community. Organic management practices that support agroforestry practices also, in turn, promote a functionally diverse herbaceous stratum. We show that functional trait syndromes in these herbaceous communities in agroforestry systems are linked with farmer perceptions of traits, and that highly interconnected farm decision-making is related to greater functional diversity in the herbaceous community. Understanding pathways of farmer decision-making on managing this herbaceous community can appropriately situate on-farm practice and policy for the transition to organic production, and inform emerging agri-environmental programs."

The aim of this work is to understand how plant diversity associated with AFS regulates the coffee berry borer (CBB) taking into account a tripartite interaction network: pest predator environment. It further seeks to understand how farmers' management practices can modify the regulating network. Using field data from coffee-based AFS and structural equation modeling, we assessed the effects of environmental conditions (% shade cover, tree area surface, coffee density) and farm management (conventional, integrated, organic) on (1) ant predatory groups, (2) the abundance and the damage from CBB and (3) their interactions. Percentage of shade cover was positively correlated to CBB initial infestation (through direct effect) and negatively through its effect on coffee phenology. A higher percentage of shade is also negatively related to damage intensity. Farmers' practices significantly reduced the CBB population without considerable side effects on the ant predatory group, probably due to the high plant diversity within these farms. The abundance of the most diversified ant predatory group has a top-down effect on the peak of the CBB infestation rate. Our approach appears promising for a better understanding of the complex regulating network in coffee AFS and confirms the importance of an integrated management strategy to reduce CBB damage.

A good example of the magnitude of these impacts are the massive crop losses experienced by coffee farmers in Central America due to coffee leaf rust. Coffee farmers need agroecosystems that are capable of regulating the negative impacts of pests and diseases while providing other ecosystem services on which their households and society depend. In this study, we aimed to identify the most promising coffee agroforestry systems for regulating diseases and ensuring the provision of other ecosystem services. During two years, in a research network of 61 coffee plots under a wide variety of shade and management conditions in Turrialba, Costa Rica, we quantified primary and secondary coffee losses (yield and economic losses) and indicators of three other ecosystem services: provisioning of agroforestry products (bananas, plantains, other fruits, and timber), maintenance of soil fertility and carbon sequestration. We then performed an analysis of the relationships between losses and ecosystem service indicators. Based on the results of relationships and on three criteria, we identified the coffee agroforestry systems that had the lowest losses due to diseases and that provided desirable levels of agroforestry products, soil fertility and carbon sequestration. We found multiple significant relationships between losses and ecosystem services (including both tradeoffs and synergies) which allowed us to derive recommendations for better management strategies to reduce yield losses. We identified six coffee agroforestry systems (CAFs) as the most promising ones for reducing losses while simultaneously providing other ecosystem services. One of these CAFs was a simple agroforestry system (dominated by service trees), three were medium diversified CAFs and two were highly diversified CAFs (systems including service trees, timber trees, fruit trees and musaceas). The six CAFS differed in their cropping practices and farmer profitability objectives. The six CAFs offer several options for the design of new coffee plantations or for the transformation of existing plantations. Several of this promising CAFs use little fungicides, which is an indicator that the reduction of chemical inputs could be possible. Our results suggest that the regulation of diseases and associated losses in agroforestry systems should be based on, and take advantage of, the positive effects of plant biodiversity, adequate shade cover, good soil fertility, and minimal use of fungicides.

Pathogen infection and colonization steps in woody vine tissues, and the hypotheses that have been formulated to explain the outburst of foliar symptoms, are reported and discussed. Factors that could aggravate or repress GTD symptoms and incidence expansion are also addressed. Vine physiology and pathology together could expand understanding of these diseases. Knowledge and hypotheses that need validation are summarized, and a conceptual model is proposed to explain the occurrence of symptoms and the influencing factors. The model could be useful to cope with the complexity of GTDs, and as a starting point for research to unravel knowledge gaps and suggest new disease management strategies.

What are the conditions for establishing agroecological production in tropical regions? Based upon case studies in several tropical areas, we provide here some answers to this question. We review the ""pillars"" (i.e. principles) and the ""implementation levers"" (i.e., tools) for the development of agroecology. We identify three main pillars: (1) the mobilization and management of ecological processes for the sustainable production and the resilience of agroecosystems; (2) the development of interactions between technical, social, environmental, and institutional components of agroecosystems for a holistic approach to agroecology; and (3) the scaling up of agroecology that takes place with a plurality of actions and pathways at different organization levels rather than an increase in resources and a replication of standardized technical processes. To implement these three pillars, we identify 11 main bio-technical, cognitive, socio-political, and organizational levers. Bio-technical levers include those for (1) mobilizing complementarity between crop species to optimize natural resources use, (2) mobilizing functional biodiversity at the plot scale to optimize natural regulation of pests and diseases, (3) managing biodiversity at landscape and territorial scales, (4) increasing the efficiency of biogeochemical cycles, and (5) renewing targets for genetic improvement. Cognitive, socio-political, and organizational levers include those for (6) political and institutional action at the national and global level, (7) action at the local level to support producers, (8) political and organizational action at the territorial level, (9) the marketing and the development of new agri-chains, (10) the development of new methods for evaluating production systems, and (11) the recognition of the values of gender and generation within families and other organisational levels. This paper provides an overall orientation for the agroecological transition in tropical agriculture and also considers the socio-political context that underlies this transition."

Drawing from a sample of 150 farmers responsible for the management of 12,096 trees, we quantified the motivations of farmers for 10 material and immaterial uses of trees and used a Bayesian modelling framework to explore the relative importance of the 4 W framework in explaining general motivations, specific to each use, as well as the varying levels of specialization in tree management strategies among farmers. The distribution of use values by category shows that the highest values are associated with (i) agronomic uses (such as shade for cocoa trees and soil fertilization), (ii) food for human consumption, (iii) social purposes, and (iv) medicinal uses. All four aspects of the 4 W framework significantly contribute to understanding farmers' deep motivations, while the influence of each 4 W determinant varies based on the specific material and immaterial uses being considered. The level of specialization or diversification in cocoa farmers' motivations is significantly influenced by their knowledge of tree species and cocoa tree density, with knowledgeable farmers exhibiting greater diversification, while higher cocoa tree density and the presence of remnant trees lead to more specialized strategies that hinder agroforestry adoption. From a political perspective, it is urgent that stakeholders involved in the promotion of agroforestry consider all dimensions of the farmer-field system. The diversity of farmers' life histories (Who), of cultivated landscapes (Where), of field systems (What), and of time trajectories (When) present both constraints and opportunities with which farmers must contend to transition to much-desired agroforestry systems."

The purpose of this study was to assess how production system and cropping system characteristics affect plantain productivity. Interviews with farmers, dynamic measurements of cropped diversity, recording of management practices and characterization of the harvested bunches were used to characterize 25 plantain fields in the form of 54 factors and 5 dependent variables. The average bunch weight measured was 11.6 kg. The within-field variability of the bunch weights measured was 4.2 kg. The calculated mean plantain yield was 6.8 t/ha/year and varied between 1.1 and 18.8 t/ha/year depending on the fields studied. Harvested bunches amounted to only 34% of the field potential. Segmentation analyses (CART) of the fields studied and analyses of variance identified 12 factors strongly linked to bunch sizes and plantain field lifetime. The highest bunch weights were measured in fields belonging to farmers who participated in training and also applied herbicide and nitrogen fertilizers more frequently and at higher rates. These practices also increased within-field variability for bunch weights. Lastly, the management practices recorded showed an intensification of chemical inputs in traditional plantain-based cropping systems. These results, especially the high within-field and between-field variability for bunch weights, call for better quantify the impact of planting material quality and varietal mixture on plantain productivity into plantain-based cropping systems.

In the present study, this strain was further characterised to investigate (1) its taxonomic position, (2) the secreted/non-secreted nature of its nematicidal compounds, and (3) its in planta biocontrol capacity towards R. duriophilus. Firstly, analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and motility test indicated that CCBLR15 was closely related to B. cereus sensu stricto. Secondly, nematodes separate expositions in vitro to CCBLR15 culture filtrate and cell lysate revealed that nematicidal activity was attributed to compounds released after bacterial cell lysis. Thirdly, CCBLR15 nematode biocontrol capacity was studied using three Coffea arabica cultivars, either seed- or cutting-propagated. Plants were therefore characterised by different developmental stages, referred to as 'early' and 'advanced', with respectively 2-3 and 6-8 leaf pairs. Additionally, plants were grown in unsterilised soil, with a one-month delay between inoculations of bacteria and nematodes to assess the persistence of the nematicidal effects. The presence of R. duriophilus in roots decreased plant growth only in one cultivar whose plants were inoculated at the 'early' stage. Nonetheless, CCBLR15 pre-inoculation significantly reduced the number of nematodes in roots of all cultivars and inhibited the negative effects of nematodes in 'early'-inoculated plants. These results demonstrate the capacity of CCBLR15 to control R. duriophilus and constitute an important step before studying the persistence of its biocontrol effects on a longer period or after plants establishment in the field.

Still, the impact of trees on the wind dynamics within agroforestry systems remains poorly understood despite the key role played by the wind in energy and mass exchanges, including disease and pest propagation. Here, we present the first detailed analysis of the wind dynamics over agroforestry systems, combining in situ measurements and instantaneous airflow simulations, with a numerical application on spore-like particle dispersion from an infection point source at crop top. Simulations reproduce remarkably well most characteristics of the turbulent wind flow within the agroforestry system. Simulations reveal the presence of two inflection points on the mean wind velocity profile, at crop and tree tops, both inducing the development of mixing-layer type eddies, controlling most of the turbulent exchanges within the agroforestry system. Relative to the local wind, the turbulence at the crop scale is more intense and intermittent in presence of trees. With increasing tree density, the turbulence at crop top becomes dominated by tree-scale motions developing at tree top. The presence of trees has a different impact on particle dispersion according to the particle size and the wind intensity. Trees accentuate the vertical and transversal dispersal of submicron spores while they enhance the short-range deposition of coarser spores on crops, the more as the wind is low, and thus limit the long-range dispersal of coarse spores. Finally, a simple parameterization of the mean wind velocity vertical profile is proposed for agroforestry systems, depending only on the foliage densities and heights of the tree and crop layers. This parameterization leads to an indication of the agroforestry system efficiency to limit spore propagation through an estimation of the Rouse number at crop top.

To this end, we analyzed interactions amongst shade trees, coffee plants (cv. Catimor), the coffee foliar disease complex and soil characteristics. We studied systems characterized by 40 variables measured in 60 plots located on three farms (monitored for 2 years) in Nicaragua. These variables characterized six system components grouped in six statistical blocks: shade trees (shade percentage and species abundancy), soil characteristics (fertility), foliar diseases, coffee plant characteristics (age and size), coffee growth and yield. We used partial least square path modelling (PLS-PM), i.e. a structural equation modelling approach used to understand and quantify interactions between the six blocks. Shade trees (mostly the associated shade percentage) had direct positive effects on foliar disease severity and incidence and soil quality, while having negative effects on coffee growth and yield. Soil characteristics (carbon, nitrogen, litter index, water infiltration potential) were negatively correlated with foliar diseases. An excessive shade percentage then had an indirect negative effect on coffee growth and yield due to the increased prevalence of foliar diseases. Finding the optimal shade cover can help reduce foliar diseases and enhance coffee berry production. The 'dose effect' of shade cover must also be considered because excessive shade, as well as lack of shade, have negative impacts on coffee growth and yield. Overall, effective shade management requires an analysis of trade-offs between soil quality, disease regulation and yield gains. In conclusion, PLS-PM turned out to be a good tool for studying agroecosystem networks and enabled us to put forward some foliar disease management and coffee yield enhancement guidelines.

Using compiled plant inventory data (from 23 sources, 2517 plots, and 148,255 individuals) encompassing four AFS (shaded coffee; shaded cocoa; dispersed trees on pastures; and live fences) across six countries in Central America we estimated different metrics of diversity to assess the conservation value of different AFS for shade plants. 458 shade plant species were recorded across the four agroforestry systems. Primary forest species accounted for 28% of the shade species recorded, but only 6% of the recorded individuals. No single AFS was consistently the most diverse across countries when considering rarefied species richness. Trees on pastures can potentially reach a similar species richness as cocoa and coffee systems but require sampled areas 7-30 times larger. In terms of composition, 29 species were shared across the agroforestry systems in different countries, illustrating the strong selection pressure of farmers for species that provide timber, firewood, and fruit. Our study highlights the potential contribution and limitations of different AFS for tree diversity conservation within agricultural landscapes."

Froehner) yield is pivotal to the profitability of the coffee industry worldwide. In this study we assess the performance of a simple process-based model for simulating and predicting robusta coffee yield at the regional scale in Vietnam. The model includes the key processes of coffee growth and development and simulates its response to variation in climate and potential water requirements throughout the growing season. The model was built and evaluated for the major Vietnamese robusta coffee-producing provinces Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, Kon Tum, and Lam Dong, using official provincial coffee yield data and climate station data for the 2001-2014 period, and field data collected during a 10-year (2008-2017) survey. Overall, good agreements were found between the observed and predicted coffee yields. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values ranged from 0.24 to 0.33 t ha(-1), and 9% to 14%, respectively. Willmott's index of agreement (WI) was greater than or equal to 0.710 in model evaluation steps for three out of five provinces. The relatively low values of WI were found for provinces with relatively low inter-annual yield variability (i.e. Dak Lak and Dak Nong). Moreover, the model was successfully tested using remote sensing satellite and model-based gridded climate data: MAPE values were <= 12% and RMSE were <= 0.29 t ha(-1). Such evaluation is important for long-term coffee productivity studies in these regions where long-term climate stations data are not readily available. The simple process-based model presented in this study could serve as a basis for developing an integrated seasonal climate-robusta coffee yield forecasting system, which would offer substantial benefits to coffee growers and industry through better supply chain management and preparedness for extreme climate events, and increased profitability.

Here, we aimed to assess the effects of adding organic matter (OM) to soil after rubber tree logging on soil functioning over time.MethodsThe experiment was conducted in two contrasting soil types in Ivory Coast. Four practices were replicated, including a control with no residues, the presence of legumes only, legumes and all tree parts excluding the trunk, and legumes and all the parts of the tree including the trunk. We monitored the response of soil nematode communities every six months for 24 months in each practice. Samples were collected from the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) in the interrow, and we also monitored soil carbon transformation by measuring in situ basal soil respiration, labile soil carbon and organic matter decay using the bait lamina method.ResultsThe results showed a sharp decrease in nematode abundance after tree logging, but OM restoration increased nematode abundance, the relative abundance of bacterivores, and resource availability to the soil food web. The resilience of the nematode communities depended on soil conditions and the amount and quality of logging residues. Total nematode abundance was positively and significantly related to soil functioning, measured through basal soil respiration, labile soil carbon, and organic matter decay rate.ConclusionThe results suggest that restoring logging residues can be an effective way to restore soil biodiversity and mitigate the negative impact of clear-cutting in tropical rubber plantations.

In the resulting post-forest landscapes, agroforestry has often been recognised as a solution to reconcile the preservation of trees and agriculture. Thus, a large number of tree plantation programs have been carried out in cocoa fields. Despite these major investments, the success of these plantations as a tool for ""reforestation"" of landscapes and sustainable timber production has never really been evaluated in fields where remnant trees, spontaneous trees and (trans) planted trees coexist. To quantify the current and future timber resource, we inventoried all trees in 150 cocoa fields distributed along the bioclimatic and historical gradients of the cocoa production area of Cote d'Ivoire, the world's leading producer. Our results show that (i) 19.6% of all associated trees are timber species, (ii) in plots where farmers actually introduced trees by planting, only 13.1% of trees have been (trans)planted, (iii) 69.7% of the current timber volume comes from remnant trees and (iv) spontaneous trees constitute 77% of the future timber resource. Based on our results, we propose 23 species along with their cultivation methods for the renewal of timber resource in cocoa fields. Overall, our results show the failure of plantation programs in cocoa fields and suggest to bet on natural regeneration to sustainably provide timber wood. Consequently, private companies supplying trees to farmers should focus on species that are complementary to those already present in natural regeneration. At the landscape level, remnant trees and residual forests should be preserved to maintain propagule sources. Finally, investments in reforestation of cocoa fields should be redirected towards training small farmers in silvicultural management techniques such as assisted natural regeneration and tree pruning."

Agroforestry practices have been proposed as a nature-based strategy for coffee farmers to mitigate and adapt to future climates. However, with agroforestry systems comes shade, a highly contentious factor for coffee production in terms of potential yield reduction, as well as additional management needs and interactions between shade trees and pest and disease. In this review, we summarize recent research relating to the effects of shade on (i) farmers' use and perceptions, (ii) the coffee microenvironment, (iii) pest and disease incidence, (iv) carbon assimilation and phenology of coffee plants, (v) coffee quality attributes (evaluated by coffee bean size, biochemical compounds, and cup quality tests), (vi) breeding of new Arabica coffee F1 hybrids and Robusta clones for future agroforestry systems, and (vii) coffee production under climate change. Through this work, we begin to decipher whether shaded systems are a feasible strategy to improve the coffee crop sustainability in anticipation of challenging climate conditions. Further research is proposed for developing new coffee varieties adapted to agroforestry systems (exhibiting traits suitable for climate stressors), refining extension tools by selecting locally-adapted shade trees species and developing policy and economic incentives enabling the adoption of sustainable agroforestry practices.

Communities were sampled at 3,694 sites distributed world-wide. We aimed to analyse the patterns of abundance, composition and network characteristics and their relationships to latitude, mean annual temperature and rainfall, land cover, soil texture and agricultural practices. Location Sites are distributed in 41 countries, ranging from 55 degrees S to 57 degrees N latitude, from 0 to 4,000 m in elevation, with annual rainfall ranging from 500 to >3,000 mm and mean temperatures of 5-32 degrees C. Time period 1980-2018. Major taxa studied All soil macroinvertebrates: Haplotaxida; Coleoptera; Formicidae; Arachnida; Chilopoda; Diplopoda; Diptera; Isoptera; Isopoda; Homoptera; Hemiptera; Gastropoda; Blattaria; Orthoptera; Lepidoptera; Dermaptera; and ""others"". Methods Standard ISO 23611-5 sampling protocol was applied at all sites. Data treatment used a set of multivariate analyses, principal components analysis (PCA) on macrofauna data transformed by Hellinger's method, multiple correspondence analysis for environmental data (latitude, elevation, temperature and average annual rainfall, type of vegetation cover) transformed into discrete classes, coinertia analysis to compare these two data sets, and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap tests to evaluate the part of the variance of the macrofauna data attributable to each of the environmental factors. Network analysis was performed. Each pairwise association of taxonomic units was tested against a null model considering local and regional scales, in order to avoid spurious correlations. Results Communities were separated into five clusters reflecting their densities and taxonomic richness. They were significantly influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture and vegetation cover. Abundance and diversity, highest in tropical forests (1,895 +/- 234 individuals/m(2)) and savannahs (1,796 +/- 72 individuals/m(2)), progressively decreased in tropical cropping systems (tree-associated crops, 1,358 +/- 120 individuals/m(2); pastures, 1,178 +/- 154 individuals/m(2); and annual crops, 867 +/- 62 individuals/m(2)), temperate grasslands (529 +/- 60 individuals/m(2)), forests (232 +/- 20 individuals/m(2)) and annual crops (231 +/- 24 individuals/m(2)) and temperate dry forests and shrubs (195 +/- 11 individuals/m(2)). Agricultural management decreased overall abundance by <= 54% in tropical areas and 64% in temperate areas. Connectivity varied with taxa, with dominant positive connections in litter transformers and negative connections with ecosystem engineers and Arachnida. Connectivity and modularity were higher in communities with low abundance and taxonomic richness. Main conclusions Soil macroinvertebrate communities respond to climatic, soil and land-cover conditions. All taxa, except termites, are found everywhere, and communities from the five clusters cover a wide range of geographical and environmental conditions. Agricultural practices significantly decrease abundance, although the presence of tree components alleviates this effect."

Cacao industry is therefore currently facing the dilemma of producing more cacao while ensuring its sustainability. Cacao monocrops and agroforestry systems (AFS) are two contrasting ways to produce cocoa, yet their impact on yields, contribution to farmer livelihood, cocoa quality remains understudied. Therefore, we reviewed existing literature comparing (1) monocrop cacao farming systems with (2) simple or (3) complex AFS. We found 19 comparisons of the cocoa yields in monocrops and simple AFS and 20 comparisons of monocrop and complex AFS. Three main research findings derive from this work. First, in about one third of cases, cacao trees yield more (or equally) in AFS than in monocrops. However, when considering only simple AFS, cacao trees yield more or equal to cacao monocrop in 52% of the cases. Second, cocoa AFS yields an average of 14% less than cacao monocrop. Yet, on average simple AFS yielded 2% less than cacao monocrops. Finally, there are too little elements to draw conclusions about the nexus between cocoa quality and cacao tree cultivation system.

Previous studies in Central Cameroon evidenced farmers' ability to realize afforestation by establishing cocoa-based agroforestry systems (cAFS) on humid savannah. In this forest-savannah transition zone, we studied an 80years chronosequence of cAFS to assess C dynamics. We selected cAFS established after forest or savannah, and we used local forest and savannah patches as controls. Aboveground carbon (AGC) was highest in the forests (118Mg C ha(-1)) and lowest in the savannahs (8Mg C ha(-1)). Systems established after forest (F-cAFS) revealed a mean AGC 40% lower than that of forests and did not evolve with time. The AGC of cAFS established after savannah (S-cAFS) increased with time and reached the mean AGC of F-cAFS (72Mg C ha(-1)) after ca. 75years. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration depended on clay content (R-2=0.55, P<0.001). The SOC concentration of F-cAFS did not evolve with time and revealed no difference with forest. In S-cAFS, considering a time of about 80years after afforestation, the average annual increase in SOC concentration in the 0-15cm layer ranged from 7.3 parts per thousand in soils with low clay content (10-15%) (R-2=0.60, P<0.01) to 9.5 parts per thousand in soils with higher clay content (20-25%). No significant change in SOC concentration was found for the 15-30cm layer. Overall, S-cAFS revealed to store and maintain significant levels of C both in the aboveground biomass and in the soil. Such an afforestation thus appeared as a valuable local strategy to combine cocoa and other perennial plant productions with C storage while avoiding deforestation.

The functioning and ecosystem services (ES) delivery of an agroecosystem can be influenced by past land-use. We hypothesised that savannah-derived cocoa agroforestry systems (S-cAFS) and forest-derived cocoa agroforestry systems (F-cAFS) would (i) progressively drift away from past land-use, and (ii) eventually converge and support comparable levels of ecosystem services. We selected 25 ecosystem attributes directly related to at least one of the following six ecosystem (dis)services (ES): species conservation, carbon storage, crop production, nutrient cycling, soil quality and soil pollution. We followed their temporal evolution in S- and F-cAFS along > 70-year chronosequences. Our results showed that the attributes and services studied followed typical temporal trajectories in S- and F-cAFS while generally tending to reach comparable levels on the long run. However, the time needed to do so varied strongly and ranged from 20 to 30 years for perennial species diversity to more than 70 years for C storage or some components of soil quality. The results also demonstrated that S-cAFS could sustainably improve many of the studied attributes and ES. Regarding the attributes related to the cocoa stand, both S- and F-cAFS seemed influenced by their previous land-use up until 15 and 30 years, respectively, after their establishment. With respect to soil quality, nutrient cycling and carbon storage, only S-cAFS could be significantly distinguished from their past land-use, after 15 to 30 years.

Through a generalized linear mixed model, we analyzed the influence of (i) the density and (ii) the height of associated species on cocoa tree productivity along a distance gradient of 0 to 5 m between cocoa trees and associated plants. We mapped 34 mature agroforestry systems in farmers' plots to locate the position of different crop species in relation to each other. The production of each plant was monitored at fortnightly intervals over one year. The main results showed that cocoa tree productivity increased in the presence of Fabaceae, even when at a short distance (< 3 m), and to a lesser extent in the presence of timber trees. All the other species, i.e., food-producing trees, had a negative effect on cocoa productivity, which diminished with increasing distance up to a distance ranging from 3 to 5 m depending on the species. The height of associated plants also had a significantly negative effect on cocoa productivity at a distance of less than 3 m, beyond which the negative effect decreased. To our knowledge, it is the first study that finely analyzes the effect of associated crops on cocoa productivity according to farmers' use and for short distances. These results are of particular interest for the structural redesign of agroforestry systems, in order to optimize their agro-economic performance, and can be used to recommend the distance to be respected between cocoa trees and associated plants as well as the height of the different crops or forest trees.

Cocoa farming is frequently associated with low incomes and little access to technical innovations for the small farmers and their families who are responsible for most cocoa production around the world. A collaborative approach, including different professionals working in the Dominican cocoa sector, led to the emergence of many technical innovations designed to modify the current agroforestry systems (AFS) in order to increase their overall productivity while maintaining a high level of biodiversity. Two types of original results are presented: (i) the co-design method that combined different participatory tools drawn from the literature and (ii) the results of applying the method for the co-design of complex AFS in four working groups. Compared to current AFS, a first level of innovation that emerged during the workshops involves the diversity and density of associated crops in AFS. The second level of innovation deals with the evolution over time and location of the different species selected for the AFS plots. This participatory work led to the formulation of four AFS prototypes whose crop species and densities follow spatio-temporal dynamics anticipated to be capable of providing better revenues while maintaining a high level of crop biodiversity. The different technical and management innovations of these prototypes are described and discussed. The AFS prototypes resulting from the co-design process will be established on farm to assess their agronomic, ecological and economic performances.

The choice of crop species and planting density in cocoa AFS has an impact on the quantities and the economic value of the agricultural products sold and consumed by producers. We characterized 140 cocoa AFS in three main production areas in the Dominican Republic, together with farmer's management practices, to construct a typology of cocoa AFS based on their structure, and evaluate their performances. The sum of the sales of cocoa, other products, and self-consumption did not differ significantly among AFS types. However, a high degree of diversification combined with a high density of associated fruit species reduced cocoa sales, but increased fruit sales and self-consumption. In contrast, a low diversity of associated plants including nitrogen-fixing trees increased cocoa sales but reduced fruit sales and self-consumption. The highest economic performance was obtained with intermediate diversity (three to seven species) and density (100-400 associated plants ha(-1)). Our results provide food for thought for optimizing crop diversity and density to adjust the economic balance between sales and self-consumption of the products harvested in cocoa AFS.

Agriculture is regularly criticized for focusing technical management of cropping systems more on production services than on support or regulation services. To achieve the agroecological intensification of cropping systems, a joint provision of multiple ES is required. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to (i) understand the determinants of the provision of ES and (ii) analyze the relationships between these services in order to (iii) identify agroecological intensification pathways. We focused our study on four ES, which are (1) coffee production, (2) water quality preservation, (3) carbon sequestration and (4) biodiversity conservation, provided by coffee agroforestry systems in a small region in Nicaragua. METHODS: A two-phase sampling scheme was implemented to measure and elucidate the provision of these services. First, we selected a large sample (82 coffee plots) to gain insight into and quantify the four ES. Secondly, we extracted a sub-sample (27 plots) showing variability in the provision of the four ES, to closely examine the determinants of the service most useful to farmers, coffee production. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results showed that carbon sequestration (in average 36 t.haxe213; 1.yrxe213; 1) was not correlated with coffee yield (in average 1127 kg.haxe213; 1.yrxe213; 1) and depended more on the presence of a few big trees in farm plots (O > 0.9 m) than on tree density. Yield increased with tree biodiversity up to a threshold (Shindex = 1.5), after which it clearly declined. The use of the most harmful pesticides to human health at higher doses than recommended did not lead to the highest yields. The most important determinants of coffee production were soil nitrogen content, soil pH, solar radiation, disease and weed incidence. Although reducing the shade tree density increased coffee production, this reduction was not necessarily related to a decrease in shade tree biodiversity and carbon sequestration, or an increase in water contamination potential. A few farmers actually achieved such high joint ES provision, in particular by selecting adequate shade trees grown at moderate densities. SIGNIFICANCE: The novelty of this article lies on an original method that consists in analyzing the ES provided by cropping systems in order to identify management strategies that are effective in providing a higher combined level of ES than those currently provided. We emphasize the importance of linking agricultural practices to the ES delivered, in order to gain an in-depth understanding of which technical levers are positively correlated with the determinants of the expected services."

These growers currently represent one of the few examples of agroforestry vineyards in the world. They offer an opportunity to analyze the structure and management of these cropping systems, and to identify the ecosystem services provided by the combination of grapevines that are trained on trees. We characterize 29 agroforestry vineyards located in three high valleys in southern Bolivia, describing the main farm features, the structure and management of the vineyards, and the advantages of on-tree vine staking as recorded by the farmers. Farms were small (2.2 ha on average), with about half viticulture and half other crops and forage. The workforce was about half family and half employees. The most commonly used tree species were the molle tree (Schinus molle) and chanar tree (Geoffroea decorticans), and the majority of grape varieties grown were landraces such as ""Negra criolla"" and ""Vicchoquena."" The main cultivation techniques were pruning of the trees and vines, application of manure more than mineral fertilizers, gravity irrigation, and application of few pesticides. The main services farmers expected from trees were protection against climate hazards and flooding, disease control, maintenance of soil fertility, and higher yields. Agroforestry is a promising option for the agroecological transition of viticulture, which deserves further studies at both plot and farm scales."

Management, weather and soil conditions are spatially variable production factors. CAF2007 is a dynamic model for coffee agroforestry systems that takes these factors as inputs and simulates the processes underlying berry production at the field scale. There remain, however, uncertainties about process rates that need to be reduced through calibration. Bayesian statistics using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is increasingly used for calibration of parameter-rich models. However, very few studies have employed multi-site calibration, which aims to reduce parameter uncertainties using data from multiple sites simultaneously. The main objectives of this study were to calibrate the coffee agroforestry model using data gathered in long-term experiments in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and to test the calibrated model against independent data from commercial coffee-growing farms. Two sub-models were improved: calculation of flowering date and the modelling of biennial production patterns. The modified model, referred to as CAF2014, can be downloaded at 10.5281/zenodo.3608877. Calibration improved model performance (higher R-2, lower RMSE) for Turrialba (Costa Rica) and Masatepe (Nicaragua), including when all experiments were pooled together. Multi-site and single-site Bayesian calibration led to similar RMSE. Validation on new data from coffee-growing farms revealed that both calibration methods improved simulation of yield and its bienniality. The thus improved model was used to test the effect of N fertilizer and shade in different locations on coffee yield.

However, little is known about their diversity, their distribution, and the threats affecting them. We compiled a global dataset of sampled earthworm communities from 6928 sites in 57 countries as a basis for predicting patterns in earthworm diversity, abundance, and biomass. We found that local species richness and abundance typically peaked at higher latitudes, displaying patterns opposite to those observed in aboveground organisms. However, high species dissimilarity across tropical locations may cause diversity across the entirety of the tropics to be higher than elsewhere. Climate variables were found to be more important in shaping earthworm communities than soil properties or habitat cover. These findings suggest that climate change may have serious implications for earthworm communities and for the functions they provide.

(Agron Sustain Dev 35:1259-1281, 2015) highlighted a missing tool for studying and improving the performance of cropping systems in the transition to highly diversified agriculture. In response, this paper proposes a concept for designing, modeling, monitoring, and auditing desired ecosystem services, in intercropping and agroforestry systems. We have labelled this concept ESSU (Ecosystem Services functional Spatial Unit). It delimits the smallest spatial unit encompassing all the interacting species and other functional components (e.g., crops, trees, livestock, spontaneous vegetation, semi-natural habitats such as hedges, ditches, forest patches, and animals) that together provide a specified set of ecosystem services. The novel ESSU concept allows representation of an entire diversified agroecosystem by the repetition of the spatial unit that provides the same sets of targeted ecosystem services as the agroecosystem it represents. It can then be used for various activities, such as the (i) design of more efficient agroecological systems according to the targeted ecosystem services; (ii) rapid audit of farming practices for biodiversity/resilience across large tracts of farmland as part of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 targets of sustainable food systems; and (iii) modeling such diversified agroecosystems using a motif adapted to represent the targeted ecosystem services and the species spacing design. We demonstrate that the ESSU concept is highly flexible and applicable to a wide range of diversified agroecosystems, like arable intercropping, crop-tree intercropping, tree-tree agroforestry, and agro-pastoralism. We also show its relevance and suitability for representing temporal changes over 1 year, across several years, and over decades, indicating its generalizability and flexibility. We argue that ESSU could open new theoretical and practical research avenues for the study of diversified agroecosystems. Considered with all the knowledge available on practices, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, ESSU might provide a learning-support tool to fill the knowledge gap about relationships among practices, biodiversity, and associated ecosystem services."

However, to our knowledge, no cacao agroforestry studies have explored how shade and its microclimate-modifying capacity influence the agrosystem's pest and disease regulating service. Utilizing thermal hygrometers and hemispherical photographs, we measured temperature and relative humidity during the dry and wet seasons as well as the shade of associated trees (associated shade), combining the latter with cacao self-shade (total shade). This approach enabled us to uncover how each shade type influences microclimate, yields, and pests and diseases beneath cacao trees. Additionally, we developed a novel method to estimate attainable yield, actual yield, and yield loss due to pests and diseases. Using yield loss as a proxy of the pest and disease regulating service and structural equation modeling, we built a model depicting the interaction network between shade types and their role in cacao pest and disease regulation. Our results showed that each shade type uniquely influenced cacao agroecosystem outcomes, with the associated shade negatively impacting attainable yield and total shade having a positive effect. Associated shade also mitigated the dry season microclimate and limited pest and disease occurrence. Notably, shade alone was not the sole pest and disease-related yield loss driver; it is part of a complex interaction network. These innovative shade measurement and yield loss estimation methods have enhanced enhance our understanding of pest and disease regulation. Conclusively, different management approaches for associated shade and total shade are crucial for optimizing yields and pest and disease regulation in cacao agroforestry systems."

Tree species selection should maximize the provision of ecosystem services while minimizing disservices. Selected species must be adapted to local agroecological conditions and cater to farmers' needs, while considering their preferences and constraints. The ShadeTreeAdvice methodology was developed to support said selection process using farmers' local ecological knowledge. It provides the steps to rapidly identify tree species and evaluate their impacts on a range of locally important ecosystem services. Results are uploaded to a decision support tool to tailor tree species recommendations to individual farmers' needs (). During the 5 year timeframe between 2016 and 2020, eight studies following this methodology were conducted in various coffee and cocoa growing regions across Africa, Asia and Central America. This article looks back at these studies to synthesize their findings and evaluate the methodology. We identified similarities in the use of tree species across different study areas, notably regarding leguminous and fruit tree species. We showed that the method was efficient to evaluate tree species' impacts on soil and climate regulation, crop production, and economic benefits. It was less efficient for evaluating impacts related to incidence of pests and diseases, often associated with knowledge gaps. The method also successfully allowed investigating the links between LEK and socio-economic groups or environmental factors. Furthermore, we suggest a series of improvements in the methodology for future studies. These improvements include (i) broadening the scope of studies beyond tree species provision of ecosystem services to include tree species impact on farming practices; (ii) allowing the comparison of tree performances in agroforestry systems versus in full sun; (iii) providing a clear pathway for validation of the results; (iv) using tree species' functional traits to generalize the results.

This study analyses the impact of young shade trees (Cinnamomum camphora, Bishofia javanica and Jacaranda mimosifolia) on microclimate, coffee fruit development cycle, coffee yield, and coffee quality only 4 years after their introduction. The results show that young shade trees reduced diurnal fluctuations in temperatures, buffered high temperatures in the rainy season (-3 to -6 degrees C), and protected coffee trees from cold temperatures in the dry season (+0.5 to +1 degrees C). Coffee flower set decreased with shade intensity, as did fruit losses during the bean filling and maturation stages. Consequently, coffee trees under B. javanica and J. mimosifolia, which both provide light shade intensity, produced yields similar to those of coffee trees in open conditions. Only coffee trees under the dense shade of C. camphora had lower yields. Shade trees did not affect the physical and organoleptic attributes of coffee beans. This study hence demonstrates that carefully selected shade trees can rapidly provide positive ecosystem services related to microclimate and coffee physiology, while maintaining a coffee yield and quality similar to those found in monoculture coffee systems. With their diffused shade, B. javanica and J. mimosifolia are suitable options for the agro-ecological intensification of coffee systems, while the use of C. camphora requires active management and pruning practices in order to sustain high coffee yield.

This study highlights the impact of young shade trees on soil quality only 4 years after their intercropping with coffee. Methods 18 young shade trees belonging to three tree species (Cinnamomum camphora,Bishofia javanicaandJacaranda mimosifolia) were selected in an intensive coffee system in Southern Yunnan. Soil samples (0-20 cm) were tested for chemical composition, soil communities and soil enzyme activities under their canopies and in open areas, both in coffee rows and inter-rows, once during the rainy and once during the dry season. Additionally, root systems were characterized using trenches. Soil water profiles and litterfall were monitored along the production cycle. Coffee yield was recorded for two consecutive years. Results We detected a positive impact of all shade tree species on soil chemical, biological and biochemical components, especially during the dry season. This positive impact included higher soil organic matter (+10%) and more abundant soil microbial communities (+64%) under shaded coffee than under open coffee. Furthermore, shaded coffee trees yielded as much as open coffee trees, except underC. camphora, probably due to high below-ground competition. Conclusions These results demonstrate that carefully selected shade trees can rapidly contribute to preserving and/or restoring soil quality in intensive coffee systems, while maintaining high coffee yield.

However, smallholder agriculture landscapes host areas containing home gardens and other agroforestry systems (AFS) proved highly relevant for soil and biodiversity conservation. The positive interactions between aboveground and belowground biodiversity probably constitute a key element to promote the efficiency of these agro-ecosystems. To determine whether a relationship exists between tree and soil macrofauna diversity and composition, we compared cacao AFS with contrasted tree diversity along a topography and forest cover gradient in Talamanca, Costa Rica. To determine which components of the shade tree species, community structure (density, richness, Shannon, Pielou), and agroforest floor best explain the macrofauna community composition and structure, we constructed the ""best models"" based on the tree composition, tree structure, and agroforest floor as explanatory matrices in redundancy analyses. Macrofauna composition was best explained by a mix of tree species and litter attributes (R2=26.5 %), whereas macrofauna and vegetation co-vary significantly with topography (R2=12 %). Macrofauna structure is best explained by a selection of seven tree species (R2=41.2 %). The co-variation with topography remained low (R2=10.9 %). Tree evenness (Pielou index) explained only 7 % of macrofauna community structure while other diversity indices were not correlated with macrofauna composition or structure. The soil macrofauna was therefore more influenced by tree identity and litter composition than by the overall diversity of the tree community. This information is important for designing the optimal combinations of species for the intensification of production and provision of ecosystem services in cacao-based AFS."

A suitable framework is therefore needed to study the viability of this emerging area of cultivation. Objectives. To carry out an assessment of the technico-economic viability of cocoa cultivation and the processing of its products. Method. The costs and benefits of two different cropping systems and three types of end products were modeled. Results. The cropping system installed after partial forest clearing requires less labor and cash flow than the system based on association with banana, which allows a return on investment before the maturity of cocoa production. In order to be viable, cropping systems whose sole purpose is the production of fermented and dried beans would require yields of approximately I ton.ha(-1) and floor prices often above (sic) 10,000.t(-1). Such a result questions the feasibility of these systems. If beans were processed into cocoa sticks or chocolate, economic viability would be more easily acquired, but this would require investments that are not necessarily compatible with the cash flow of farms currently involved in cocoa fanning. Conclusions. These results highlight the need to (re)consider in French overseas regions: (i) the nature and use of species associated with cocoa trees; (ii) the status of the cocoa tree as the main crop (or not) on farms; (iii) the diversification of cocoa products making it possible to feed several markets; (iv) the collective organization of the emerging sector to support production and processing; (v) technical and financial support (e.g.: CAP aid) for fanners embarking on cocoa farming."

However, the analysis of competition effects in multispecific complex agricultural systems remains a key lock-in preventing both (i) a thorough understanding of resource partitioning, and (ii) the co-design of spatial patterns and management of cocoa AFS (cAFS) minimising competition. We sampled 48 cAFS 1000 m2 plots in Central Cameroon and used an individual based approach to analyse the effect neighbouring tree community composition had on coca tree pod production. First, we determined the distance up to which each neighbouring tree influenced the production of a given cocoa tree and checked for the significance and the magnitude of this effect. We then explored the trade-offs between cocoa tree production and the abundance of associated trees. Our results first underline a significant intra-specific competition within the cocoa tree populations studied, which would need to be thinned down to 800-1100 individuals per ha. We also found a general negative effect of associated trees kept or grown for their fruits (e.g. mango, traditional species, citrus trees). Those effects were stronger when the trees were positioned between 6 and 11 m away from the cocoa trees. These trees clearly impaired pod production, especially for small diameter cocoa trees. Palm trees, however, had a positive effect on cocoa pod production, with suitable densities modelled ranging from 0 to 240 individuals per ha. Finally, we found both positive and negative effects of associated forest trees on cocoa pod production, which varied with the distance separating them from the cocoa trees and the size of the cocoa trees. Overall, our analyses show that cocoa production in complex cAFS is influenced both by intra-and inter-specific interactions while it remains difficult to distinguish between potential intertwined effects and resource limitations.

To better understand the mass flow of carbon and nutrients into the soil sub-system under various contexts we quantified the mass flow of litterfall, its composition and seasonal variations in different agroforestry systems in Bokito (Central Cameroon). We studied litterfall dynamics and in situ leaf-litter cycling of cAFS established on past forest lands (F-cAFS) and savannah (S-cAFS). We also studied the decomposition of cocoa and associated tree leaf-litter in litterbags. Local secondary semi-deciduous forests were included as control. Annual litterfall in full-grown cAFS (> 15 years old) was high (9.4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1)) and represented ca. 67% of litterfall in control forests. In full-grown cAFS, associated tree leaf-litter contributed to litterfall the most and ranged between 60 and 70% of the total amount recorded (6.3 Mg ha(-1) y(-1)). The quantities and dynamics of the litter components monitored were similar in full-grown S- and F-cAFS. The microclimate was best buffered in forests and least buffered in young S-cAFS but could not be linked to leaf-litter decomposition. Forest leaf litterfall was higher and tended to cycle faster than total leaf-litter of cAFS, whose decomposition appeared limited by cocoa leaf-litter quality. Our study underlines (i) the critical contribution of associated trees to the nutrient cycle of agroecosystems established on poor soils and, (ii) the ability of farmers to channel associated tree communities towards similar functioning despite different past land-uses.

The impacts of the climatic conditions on bean physical characteristics and chemical composition were assessed. RESULTSWe showed that the environment had a significant effect on the bean density and on all bean chemical compounds. The environment effect was stronger than the genotype and genotype-environment interaction effects for cafestol, kahweol, arachidic (C20:0), behenic acid (C22:0), 2,3-butanediol, 2-methyl-2-buten-1-ol, benzaldehyde, benzene ethanol, butyrolactone, decane, dodecane, ethanol, pentanoic acid, and phenylacetaldehyde bean content. A 2 degrees C increase in temperature had more influence on bean chemical compounds than a 100 mm increase in soil water content. Temperature was positively correlated with lipids and volatile compounds. With an innovative method using iterative moving averages, we showed that correlation of temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and rainfall with lipids and volatiles was higher between the 10th and 20th weeks after flowering highlighting this period as crucial for the synthesis of these chemicals. Genotype specific responses were evidenced and could be considered in future breeding programmes to maintain coffee beverage quality in the midst of climate change. CONCLUSIONThis first study of the effect of the genotype-environment interactions on chemical compounds enhances our understanding of the sensitivity of coffee quality to genotype environment interactions during bean development. This work addresses the growing concern of the effect of climate change on speciality crops and more specifically coffee. (c) 2023 The Authors.

However, theresponse to drought of coffee F1 hybrids has seldom been assessed. Methods: A trial was established with five C. arabica genotypes (2 pure lines: Catimor and Marsellesa and 3 F1 hybrids: Starmaya, Centroamericano and Mundo Maya) planted under the leguminous tree species Leuceana leucocephala. Coffee growth, yield and physiological responses were assessed under a rain-fed (control: CON) and a rainfall reduction treatment (RR) for 2 years. Results: The RR treatment created a long-term rainfall deficit in a region with suboptimal temperature similar to those predicted by climate change scenarios. Moreover, the RR treatment reduced soil water content by 14% over 2 successive years of production and increased hydric stress of the three F1-hybrids (leaf water potentials averaged -0.8 MPa under RR compared with -0.4 MPa under CON). Under RR, coffee yields were reduced from 16 to 75% compared to CON. Mundo Maya F1 hybrid was the sole high-yielding genotype apable of sustaining its yield under RR conditions. Our results suggested that its significant increase in fine root density (CON = 300 and RR = 910 root.m-2) and its maintenance of photosynthetic rate (2.5 - 3.5 mmol CO2 m-2 s-1) at high evaporative demand might explain why this genotype maintained high yield under RR condition. Discussion: This work highlights a possible drought tolerance mechanism in fruit bearing adult coffee trees where the plant fine root number increases to intake more water in order to preserve turgor and sustainphotosynthesis at high ETo and therefore conserves high yield in dry conditions.

In cocoa agroforestry systems (cAFS), shade trees are used to supply many services to farmers, yet their impact on soil functioning and cocoa yields is likely to vary substantially among tree species. Here we compared the impact of five shade tree species (Canarium schweinfurthii (Canarium), Dacryodes edulis (Safou), Milicia excelsa (Iroko), Ceiba pentandra (Kapok tree), Albizia adianthifolia (Albizia)) and unshaded conditions on the functioning of poor sandy savanna soils within eight cocoa farms in Central Cameroon. We assessed the effects of plant functional traits, leaf litterfall and fine root biomass on a range of soil functions and on cocoa yield. Shade trees generally improved soil pH, NH4+, NO3- and Olsen P content, biomass production of bioassays and soil total C and N content, while leaving cocoa yields unchanged. However, these effects varied largely among species. Improvements of soil functions were low under the two fruit trees (Canarium and Dacryodes), medium under the legume tree Albizia and high under the two timber trees (Milicia and Ceiba). Low litter recalcitrance was most strongly associated with increases in soil fertility indicators such as N and P availability, whereas soil C and N content increased with litter Ca restitution. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that cocoa agroforest multifunctionality is substantially influenced by the functional traits of shade tree species. Shade tree species with the most dissimilar traits to cocoa (cocoa showing the lowest leaf litter quality) showed the largest improvement of soil functions. Therefore, selection of shade trees based on their functional traits appears as a promising practice to adequately manage soil functioning. In order to fully assess the beneficial role of shade trees in these agroecosystems. Future research will need to extend this approach to other below-ground traits and other aspects of multifunctionality such as long-term cocoa health and yield.

Nonetheless, criteria to select the most suitable plant communities for agroecosystems diversification facing contrasting environmental constraints need to be refined. Here, we compared the impacts of 24 different plant communities on soil fertility across six tropical agroecosystems: either on highly weathered Ferralsols, with strong P limitation, or on partially weathered soils derived from volcanic material, with major N limitation. In each agroecosystem, we tested several plant communities for diversification, as compared to a matching low diversity management for their cropping system. Plant residue restitution, N, P and lignin contents were measured for each plant community. In parallel, the soil under each community was analyzed for organic C and N, inorganic N, Olsen P, soil pH and nematode community composition. Soil potential fertility was assessed with plant bioassays under greenhouse controlled climatic conditions. Overall, plant diversification had a positive effect on soil fertility across all sites, with contrasting effects depending on soil type and legumes presence in the community. Communities with legumes improved soil fertility indicators of volcanic soils, which was demonstrated through significantly higher plant biomass production in the bioassays (+18%) and soil inorganic N (+26%) compared to the low diversity management. Contrastingly, communities without legumes were the most beneficial in Ferralsols, with increases in plant biomass production in the bioassays (+39%), soil Olsen P (+46%), soil C (+26%), and pH (+5%). Piecewise structural equation models with Shipley's test revealed that plant diversification impacts on volcanic soil fertility were related to soil N availability, driven by litter N. Meanwhile, Ferralsols fertility was related to soil P availability, driven by litter P. These findings underline the importance of multifactorial and multi-sites experiments to inform trait-based frameworks used in designing optimal plant diversification in agroecological systems.

The use of shade trees and the organic management of coffee crops are welcome alternatives, aiming to reduce synthetic inputs and restore soil biological balance. However, little is known about the impacts of the different types of shade tree species on soil functioning and fauna. In this paper, we assess soil nutrient availability and food web structure on a 17-year old experimental coffee plantation in Turrialba in Costa Rica. Three shade types (unshaded coffee, shaded with Terminalia amazonia, and shaded with Erythrina poepiggiana) combined with two management practices (organic and conventional) were evaluated. Total C and N, inorganic N and Olsen P content, soil pH, global soil fertility, and nematode and microarthropod communities were measured in the top 10 cm soil layer, with the objective of determining how shade tree species impact the soil food web and soil C, N and P cycling under different types of management. We noted a decrease in soil inorganic N content and nematode density under conventional management (respectively -47% and -91% compared to organic management), which suggested an important biological imbalance, possibly caused by the lack of organic amendment. Under conventional management, soil nutrient availability and fauna densities were higher under shade, regardless of the shade tree species. Under organic management, only soils under E. poeppigiana, a heavily pruned. N-2 -fixing species, had increased nutrient availability and fauna density, while T amazonia shade had a null or negative impact. The effects of coffee management and shade type on soil nutrient availability were mirrored by changes in soil food web structure. Higher fertility was recorded in soil with balanced food webs. These results emphasize the importance of the choice of shade tree species for soil functions in low input systems, more so than in fertilized systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Shade canopies are characterized in terms of tree density (N, trees ha(-1)), tree basal area (G, m(2) ha(-1)) and percent canopy cover (%Cov). N, G and %Cov are named shade canopy density variables (SCDV). The use of these SCDV has two important limitations: (1) different combinations of values of the three SCDV variables generate very different shade tree stands (hence very different shading levels), and (2) Additional factors modify shading under shade canopies with constant SCDV values. This article uses the software ShadeMotion (www.shademotion.net) to show how 24 different, simple, even-sized, mono-layered, Cordia alliodora shade canopies with constant N, G and %Cov display significantly different shade levels and temporal patterns of shading depending on tree stem and crown diameter ratios, tree height, spatial planting configurations (square, random and alleys) and leaf fall patterns. A minimum set of variables capable of providing a more accurate description of the shading characteristics of a cocoa or coffee shade canopy is proposed. Our findings can shed light on the current debate on the pros and cons of the definitions of cocoa agroforestry used by chocolate and certification companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and donors, especially in West and Central Africa. In this article, emphasis is given to cocoa, but the analysis, results and conclusions are equally applicable to coffee agroforestry systems.

To date, however, there is no systematic analysis of scientific evidence for the extent to which these practices can provide the multiple benefits needed for smallholders to adapt to climate extremes. In this paper, we searched scientific databases to review scientific evidence of the benefit provided by twenty-six practices in crops commonly farmed by smallholders in the region and highly relevant for their food and nutrition security; namely, coffee, maize and beans. We reviewed scientific documents (n = 304) published in the period 1953-2021 to register evidence of the practices' effects on fifty-five benefits. Our analysis of these documents found measurement records (n = 924) largely based on field experiments (85%). Our results show strong evidence of the multiple benefits that some ecosystem-based practices (e.g., tree-based practices for coffee and no tillage for maize) can provide to support the adaptation to climate extremes of smallholder farming systems and enhance a farm's natural assets (e.g., biodiversity, water, soil). We also found that the majority of research on practices in the region focused more on the socioeconomic dimension (54%) rather than on the capacity of practices to improve the natural assets of a smallholder farmers or reduce the impact of climate extremes. Given these knowledge gaps, we discuss the importance of a renovated investment in research to address existing knowledge gaps. Our concluding suggestions for future research include the need for systematizing existing knowledge from different sources (e.g., peer-reviewed, gray literature, farmers, extension agencies, etc.), and to assess the extent to which these practices can provide multiple benefits for smallholder farming systems by improving their wellbeing, reducing their vulnerability to different hydroclimatic extremes while also contributing to ecosystem services provision at the landscape level."

To this end, shaded agroforestry systems are a promising strategy. Background and Objectives: Understanding local contexts is a prerequisite for designing locally tailored systems; this can be achieved by utilizing farmers' knowledge. Our objective is to explore ecosystem services (ESs) provided by different shade tree species as perceived by farmers and possible factors (elevation, gender, and membership in local farmers groups) influencing these perceptions. We related these factors, as well as farmers' ESs preferences, to planting densities of tree species. Materials and Methods: During interviews with 263 small-scale coffee farmers on the southern slope of Mt. Kilimanjaro, they ranked the most common shade tree species according to perceived provision of the locally most important ESs for coffee farmers. We asked them to estimate the population of each tree species on their coffee fields and to identify the three ESs most important for their household. Results: Food, fodder, and fuelwood emerged as the most important ESs, with 37.8% of the respondents mentioning all three as priorities. Density of tree species perceived to provide these three ESs were significantly higher for farmers prioritizing these services compared to farmers that did not consider all three ESs in their top three. Albizia schimperiana scored the highest for all rankings of regulatory ESs such as coffee yield improvement, quality shade provision, and soil fertility improvement. Influence of elevation, gender, and farmer group affiliation was negligible for all rankings. Conclusions: This study shows the need to understand factors underlying farmers' management decisions before recommending shade tree species. Our results led to the upgrade of the online tool (shadetreeadvice.org) which generates lists of potential common shade tree species tailored to local ecological context considering individual farmers' needs."

This study investigated seasonal variations in flowering and fruiting among trees in populations of mixed cacao genotypes. The intensities of crown and trunk flowering and pod production were monitored for eight consecutive six-monthly seasons on 114 adult cacao trees grown from seedlings. We investigated distributions of seasonal flowering and fruiting values, relationships between flowering and pod production, and the effects of seasonal cumulative rainfall. The patterns of seasonal flowering and fruiting series were analyzed using two descriptors: the first distinguishing between regular and variable patterns, and the second analyzing the structure of such variability, classifying it as either irregular or alternating. Despite being subjected to similar climate and agronomic management, individual trees exhibited highly variable flowering and fruiting behaviors within each season, as well as variable patterns of flowering and fruiting across seasons. Seasonal alternate fruiting on a population scale masked highly variable patterns among trees, and only 19 % of the trees exhibited marked alternate fruiting patterns. Variations in pod production on a tree scale were mainly related to variations in trunk flowering. Endogenous factors seemed to control seasonal variations in flowering and fruiting, even though exogenous factors, both climatic and agronomic, could structure flowering and fruiting patterns at the orchard scale.

It was found to be efficient at inducing genetic and epigenetic variations. The present study is a part of a program designed at improving the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera L. cv. Barhee, through induced somaclonal variation. In this work, caulogenic cultures were subcultured on MS media supplemented with 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg L-1 2,4-D in order to induce genetic and epigenetic variations. The highest doses of 2,4-D were found to induce severe negative effects on in vitro cultures, although some tissues were able to survive and to produce calli with high morphogenetic capacities. Our analysis showed some significant effect of 2,4-D on several physiological parameters. Indeed, chlorophyll and growth rates were found to drastically decrease while proline content increased from 535 to 2973 nmol g(-1) FW when 40 mg L-1 2,4-D were used. In vitro cultures showed several signs of oxidative stress, such as high levels of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde; likewise, the specific activity of several antioxidant enzyme was found to increase. Plant regeneration from in vitro cultures treated with 2,4-D was obtained after subculturing explants onto PGR-free media. The ISSR analysis of 2,4-D-treated material showed that this plant growth regulator (PGR) induced measurable genetic variations. The global DNA methylation rates (GMR) as estimated through the HPLC analysis of nucleosides also confirmed the presence of epigenetic changes caused by 2,4-D as GMRs increased from 13.8 to 18.93%."

We cultivated actively proliferating buds of Phoenix dactylifera L. cv. Barhee in a temporary immersion system and we monitored the bioactive compound accumulation after 7 days of culture. Methods Total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) contents were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and radical scavenging activity using DPPH and ABTS assays. We also explored the activity of phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes, namely phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Results Our results revealed that MeJA treatment induced oxidative stress, and at the same time increased the activity of related defense enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. Exogenous application of MeJA at 200 mu M increased ROS (two fold), hydrogen peroxide (3.7 fold), nitric oxide (14 fold), MDA (6.3 fold), superoxide dismutase (5.9 fold), catalase (4.4 fold) and guaiacol peroxidase (3.87 fold). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that 200 mu M MeJA treatment enhanced the activities of PAL (3.65 fold), TAL (4.35 fold), PPO (threefold) and increased TPC (twofold) and TFC (1.75 fold) contents in buds cultures higher than the control. HPLC analysis showed that buds cultures exposed to 200 mu M MeJA accumulated maximum amount of catechin (11 fold), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (1.48 fold), caffeic acid (2.5 fold) and p-coumaric acid (1.76 fold) and demonstrate antioxidant capacity with the lowest DPPH (114.5 mu g ml(-1)) and ABTS (90.2 mu g ml(-1)) IC50 values on day 7 of culture as compared to the control. The MeJA in the culture medium directly reduced cell viability in a dose dependent manner up to 35% with the highest concentration. Conclusion The results of this study has revealed, for the first time, that MeJA offers a promising potential for the production of phenolic compound in Phoenix dactylifera L. buds.

This is done by combining (i) multiyear continuous dynamic chamber measurements from sites with different fertilisation levels, (ii) static chamber measurements taken along a typical sloping coffee field and (iii) measurements from a laboratory incubation experiment with nutrient addition to different soil types. In the field and in the laboratory, additions included standard NPK fertiliser, ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) as well as potassium nitrate (KNO3). Soils in a laboratory experiment were incubated under both drained and flooded conditions. Continuous measurements from automatic chambers show that annual N2O fluxes were dominated by bursts over few weeks following N-fertilisation with peak emissions up to 60 g N-N2O ha(-1) day(-1). A two-month slope experiment with static chambers after KNO3-fertilisation with 90 kg N ha 1 showed N2O significant differences between the highest daily emission rates from the top and the bottom of the slope (134 +/- 20 g N-N2O ha(-1) and 336 +/- 104 g N-N2O ha(-1), respectively) which can be explained by NO3- transport downhill and flooded conditions favouring denitrification at the bottom of the slope. Incubation experiments indicate that denitrification is the main process controlling N2O emissions but also that nitrification can result in low N2O emission rates under drained conditions. It can be concluded that the reported N2O emissions from the coffee agroforestry systems are generally low, but may be underestimated, as both poorly drained depressions functioning as N2O hotspots as well as temporal N2O bursts need to be taken into account.

Land use and land use changes can critically affect SOC. However, despite various methodological developments, there is still no scientific consensus on the best method to assess the holistic impact of land use and land use change within LCA. The SOCLE project aimed to review how SOC contribution to climate change is accounted for in LCA and to test the feasibility and sensitivity of best methodological options. Methods In total, five crop products (annual/perennial, temperate/tropical) and two livestock products were investigated through 22 scenarios of land use changes (LUC) and agricultural land management changes (LMC). Three methods were applied: IPCC Tier 1-2 (2006), Muller-Wenk and Brandao (2010) and Levasseur et al. (2012). We also carried out a sensitivity analysis on key variables, notably carbon stocks, reference states, and regeneration times. Results and discussion The accounting for LUC and LMC influenced greatly the results on the climate change impact. Compared to the impact of other GHG emissions, (i) LUC impacts ranged from - 23 to + 1702% with the IPCC method and from - 5 to + 336% with the Muller-Wenk and Brandao method, and (ii) LMC impacts from - 130 to + 54% and from - 31 to + 11%, respectively. The sensitivity analyses stressed the critical influence of all methodological and data choices on final results. Conclusions Based on the project results, we recommend accounting systematically for the impact of LULUC on climate change by applying,a minima, the comprehensive IPCC Tier 1 approach (2006), which provides default factors for SOC accounting. Where available, case-specific data should be used (e.g., Tier 2) for SOC stocks but also C:N ratio in order to model the degressive impact over 90% of the time period needed to reach equilibrium.

";;;WOS:000486706600003;;;74-87;;;;;;Description of the subject. With increasing concerns on the sustainability of agricultural systems, many tools have been developed to assess farm sustainability. Objectives. The main objective of this study was to assess and compare the sustainability of different forms of family farm organization. A second objective was to test the relevance of the IDEA method (Indicateurs de Durabilite des Exploitations Agricoles or Farm Sustainability Indicators) to compare tree-crop-based family farms in tropical areas. Method. Percentages of sustainability were calculated based on individual interviews conducted with 25 rubber fanners representing three different types of farm (typology based on the labor used for farming activities), using three scales and 10 components. Results. The socio-territorial scale was the weak point of the rubber farms. In contrast, the economic scale was relatively the best asset on all farms. The factor that most differentiated the three types of farm was the agro-ecological scale followed by the socio-territorial scale. The economic scale did not discriminate. Moreover, only the diversity of production and efficiency components showed a notable difference between the different types of farm. Conclusions. Overall, the three types of farm with contrasting forms of farm organization were not much different in terms of sustainability performance. Family business farms with managerial family labor appeared to be the least sustainable. Thus, as family business farms are becoming more and more important in Thai agriculture, if these results are confirmed on a broader scale, this represents an issue for the sustainability of the Thai rubber sector that would require government intervention.

Here, we develop a spatially resolved method that can quantify the impact of nitrogen emissions to air, soil, freshwater or coastal water on ""safe operating space"" (SOS) for natural soil, freshwater and coastal water. The method can be used to identify potential ""planetary boundary hotspots"" in the life cycle of products and to inform appropriate interventions. The method is based on a coupling of existing environmental models and the identification of threshold and reference values in natural soil, freshwater and coastal water. The method is demonstrated for a case study on nitrogen emissions from open-field tomato production in 27 farming areas based on data for 199 farms in the year 2014. Nitrogen emissions were modelled from farm-level data on fertilizer application, fuel consumption and dimate- and soil conditions. Two sharing principles, ""status quo"" and ""gross value added"", were tested for the assignment of SOS to 1 t of tomatoes. The coupling of models and identification of threshold and reference values resulted in spatially resolved characterization factors applicable to any nitrogen emission and estimations of SOS for each environmental compartment. In the case study, tomato production was found to range from not transgressing to transgressing its assigned SOS in each of the 27 farming areas, depending on the receiving compartment and sharing principle. A high nitrogen use efficiency scenario had the potential to reverse transgressions of assigned SOS for up to three farming locations. Despite of several sources of uncertainty, the developed method may be used in decision-support by stakeholders, ranging from individual producers to global governance institutions. To avoid sub-optimization, it should be applied with methods covering the other planetary boundaries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The data used came from surveys with 469 farmers. The case of Thai rubber-based family farms is specific but also brings generic insights to the debate. Classifying the farms based on their mode of organisation helps in understanding farmers' overall strategies regarding farming and non-farm activities. These differences were important and were linked to the capacity of family labour to develop non-farm activities. However, surprisingly, no discrimination among the types of farms appeared based on the agricultural production system. This finding appeared counter-intuitive given the importance of hired labour in rubber family farming. The non-significant differences for the practices and the land and labour productivities engaged in rubber cropping could be linked to the use of share-croppers (and not wage employees) as external labour. Further research needs to identify factors that can unlock productivity in the rubber plantations, whatever the category of holding. The importance of pluri-activity has strong implications that will require expanding empirical works focusing on labour issues.

This diversity of stakeholders involved along the production and marketing chain could result in the variability of the latex quality delivered to the factories. Latex processing industries need a raw material with consistently specified properties. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the factors that could affect latex properties. However, a complete description of the practices from the farmer to the factory is missing. Thus, a study was conducted to (1) characterise the upstream practices, (2) identify variable practices and (3) analyse farmers' and traders' perceptions of field latex quality that are believed to influence their practices. A survey was conducted with 398 field latex producers and 182 field latex traders distributed in eight provinces of Southern Thailand. The results showed that some agronomic practices in the mature plantations presented homogeneity (planting material, weed control, management of the inter-row of the plantations) while others (fertilisation, tapping panel treatment, harvesting practices) presented important diversity. Farmers' and traders' post-harvest practices presented limited sources of contamination. Nonetheless, for both stakeholders, an important possible source of variability was the quantity of latex preservative used. Finally, the analysis of the practices and the perception of the stakeholders clearly showed that field latex quality was determined both before and after harvesting. Research is still needed to analyse the impact of some agronomic practices on field latex quality. Latex traders also appeared as key stakeholders dealing with the quality.

Supply chains and cropping systems are very diverse, with contrasted potentials and performance, as well as environmental impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies are needed to inform on reduction in impacts, but there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the variability of existing LCA results and impacts of the cropping systems and their trade-offs along the supply chains. In an attempt to address this knowledge gap, the paper presents a systematic literature review of coffee LCA, considering a total of 34 studies covering 234 coffee systems. Global warming potential (GWP) was the impact category most reported in the literature, but the results varied greatly at both the farm and drink levels. For the former, the GWP values ranged from 0.15 to 14.5 (median: 3.6) kg CO 2 eq./kg green coffee beans and for the latter the values ranged from 2 to 23 (median: 8.8) kg CO 2 eq./kg consumed coffee in drinks. Main contributors to the GWP of production of green coffee beans were land use change (LUC), fertilisers and wet processing. However, there were great inconsistencies across studies in terms of LUC accounting, field emissions and wet process modelling. Green coffee beans production was also the main contributor to the GWP of coffee consumed, followed by brewing and coffee cup washing. Some studies covered other impacts, in addition to GWP. At both the farm and drink levels, fertilisers and pesticides were the main contributors to eutrophication and acidification, and to ecotoxicity, respectively. Brewing was the second main contributor at the drink level, in some cases the top contributor for energy -related indicators. Assumptions on packaging, cup washing and waste disposal were highly variable across studies. Water impact indicators were hardly comparable due to the system variability and method inconsistencies. Given the large diversity of coffee cropping systems worldwide, but also the diversity of possible coffee drinks, we recommend that LCA studies be standardised with respect to the definition of the functional unit, including consistent quality aspects for both green coffee beans (moisture) and coffee drinks (organoleptic properties). They should also be more thorough in detailing processes at all stages. More attention should be paid to the farming system complexity and a mass balance should be ensured when assessing biomass flows concerning LUC, co -products and residue emissions. Finally, more primary data would be needed to decipher the cropping system diversity, as well as to characterise emissions from all inputs to the field and bean processing, notably for wet and semi -wet processing.

The effect of fertilization on NR yield is still unclear and is poorly documented particularly in Thailand, the world leader in NR production. Hence, the main objective of this study was to re-assess the possible effects of fertilization on the yield of intensively managed rubber plantations in Thailand. Our main hypothesis was that the effect of fertilization would be higher with intensive latex harvesting practices (high tapping frequency with ethylene stimulation). To test this hypothesis, we set-up a split-plot experiment with four fertilization doses (T1, no fertilization, T2, T3, T4, respectively low, medium and high doses of NPK fertilizer) and two tapping systems (S/2 d2 with and without ethylene stimulation). Here, we present the results of the first three years on dry rubber yield, latex metabolism assessed with the latex diagnosis method, and latex and rubber properties related to their technological properties. Our results showed a positive effect of fertilization on yield from the first year, but the effect was only statistically significant (p < 0.05) in the third year. The maximum effect of fertilization (+13%) compared to the control treatment (T1) was obtained with the highest dose of fertilizer (T4). Cumulatively over the 3-year period, the increase in yield was +5% with the T2 dose, and +8% with the T3 and T4 dose. Contrary to our main assumption, we observed no interaction between fertilization and ethylene stimulation. Latex diagnosis revealed that the effect of fertilization on yield was linked with a direct effect on latex metabolism mainly through an increase in inorganic phosphorus content (Pi). Finally, we observed no detrimental effect of the fertilizer treatments on latex and rubber quality. We can thus conclude that increasing latex yield through fertilization combined with intensive tapping does not involve any identified risks for the quality of rubber. Taken together, our results demonstrate that fertilization can help increase the yield of rubber plantations where intensive latex harvesting is practised. However, in a context of low NR prices for rubber farmers, the economic return of a +8% increase in yield is questionable. Our trial is continuing to assess the long term effects of the fertilization on yield as well as on the growth and nutritional status of the trees, and the nutrient balance of the plantation.

They are both known to affect catabolism, with rather opposite effects: inhibition of glycolysis and higher glycolytic fermentative flux, respectively. But surprisingly, the effect of their combination on plant metabolism has never been examined precisely. Here, we applied a combined treatment (K availability and waterlogging) to sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants under controlled greenhouse conditions and performed elemental quantitation, metabolomics, and isotope analyses at different sampling times. Whereas separate K deficiency and waterlogging caused well-known effects such as polyamines production and sugar accumulation, respectively, waterlogging altered K-induced respiration enhancement (via the C-5-branched acid pathway) and polyamine production, and K deficiency tended to suppress waterlogging-induced accumulation of Krebs cycle intermediates in leaves. Furthermore, the natural N-15/N-14 isotope composition (delta N-15) in leaf compounds shows that there was a change in nitrate circulation, with less nitrate influx to leaves under low K availablity combined with waterlogging and more isotopic dilution of lamina nitrates under high K. Our results show that K deficiency and waterlogging effects are not simply additive, reshape respiration as well as nitrogen metabolism and partitioning, and are associated with metabolomic and isotopic biomarkers of potential interest for crop monitoring.

Effects of K deficiency have been investigated for several decades and recently progress has been made in identifying metabolomics signatures thereby offering potential to monitor the K status of crops in the field. However, effects of low K conditions could also be due to the antagonism with other nutrients like calcium (Ca) and the well-known biomarker of K deficiency, putrescine, could be a response to Ca/K imbalance rather than K deficiency per se. To sort this out, we carried out experiments in sunflower grown at either low or high K, at high or low Ca, with or without putrescine added to the nutrient solution. Using metabolomics and proteomics analysis, we show that a significant part of the low K response, such as lower photosynthesis and N assimilation, is due to calcium and can be suppressed by low Ca conditions. Putrescine addition tends to restore photosynthesis and N assimilation but unlike low Ca does not suppress but aggravates the impact of low K conditions on catabolism, including the typical fall-over in pyruvate kinase. We conclude that (a) the effects of K deficiency on key metabolic processes can be partly alleviated by the use of low Ca and not only by K fertilization and (b) in addition to its role as a metabolite, putrescine participates in acclimation to low K via the regulation of the content in enzymes involved in carbon primary metabolism.

This species is a strong potassium (K)-demanding species cultivated in regions where soil K availability is generally low and waterlogging due to tropical heavy rains can limit further nutrient absorption. However, the metabolic effects of K and waterlogging have never been assessed precisely. Here, we examined the metabolic response of oil palm saplings in the glasshouse under controlled conditions (nutrient composition with low or high K availability, with or without waterlogging), using gas exchange, metabolomics and proteomics analyses. Our results showed that both low K and waterlogging have a detrimental effect on photosynthesis but stimulate leaf respiration, with differential accumulation of typical metabolic intermediates and enzymes of Krebs cycle and alternative catabolic pathways. In addition, we found a strong relationship between metabolic composition, the rate of leaf dark respiration, and cumulated respiratory loss. Advert environmental conditions (here, low K and waterlogging) therefore have an enormous effect on respiration in oil palm. Leaf metabolome and proteome appear to be good predictors of carbon balance, and open avenues for cultivation biomonitoring using functional genomics technologies.

In the recent past, oil palm cultivation has been controversial not only because of land utilisation at the expense of primary tropical forests or health concerns associated with palm oil, but also pollution caused by fertilization (including CO2 produced to synthesise fertilizers). Oil palm fields are heavily fertilized with potassium (K), and thus finding better, more parsimonious methods to monitor K nutrition is more important than ever. Here, we suggest that metabolomics and subsequent machine learning of metabolic signatures represent a promising tool to probe K requirements, opening avenues for precision agriculture in oil palm industry.

In addition to nitrate concentration, the delta N-15 value in plants is also influenced by isotopic heterogeneity amongst organs and metabolites. However, our current understanding of delta N-15 values in nitrate is limited by the relatively small number of compound-specific data. We extensively measured delta N-15 in nitrate at different time points, in sunflower and oil palm grown at fixed nitrate concentration, with nitrate circulation being varied using potassium (K) conditions and waterlogging. There were strong interorgan delta N-15 differences for contrasting situations between the two species, and a high N-15-enrichment in root nitrate. Modelling shows that this N-15-enrichment can be explained by nitrate circulation and compartmentalisation whereby despite a numerically small flux value, the backflow of nitrate to roots via the phloem can lead to a c. 30 parts per thousand difference between leaves and roots. Accordingly, waterlogging and low K conditions, which down-regulate sap circulation, cause a decrease in the leaf-to-root isotopic difference. Our study thus suggests that plant delta N-15 can be used as a natural tracer of N fluxes between organs and highlights the potential importance of delta N-15 of circulating phloem nitrate.

Having such pieces of information is nevertheless essential to identify metabolic signatures to monitor K fertilization. This is particularly true in oil-producing crop species such as oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which is strongly K-demanding and involves high sugar dependence for fruit formation because of low carbon use efficiency in lipid synthesis. Here, we used metabolic analyses, measured sugar export rates with C-13 isotopic labeling and examined the effects of K availability on both leaflet and rachis sugar metabolism in oil palm seedlings. We show that low K leads to a modification of sugar composition mostly in rachis and decreased sucrose and hexose export rates from leaflets. As a result, leaflets contained more starch and induced alternative pathways such as raffinose synthesis, although metabolites of the raffinose pathway remained quantitatively minor. The alteration of glycolysis by low K was compensated for by an increase in alternative sugar phosphate utilization by tyrosine metabolism, resulting in considerable amounts of tyramine and dopamine.

Oil palm mesocarp lipids are used for myriads industrial applications, and market demand has been growing for decades. In addition, oil palm seeds are oleaginous, and the oil extracted therefrom can be used for several purposes, from food to cosmetics. As such, there is a huge need in oil palm seeds to maintain the global cohort of more than 2 billion trees. However, oil palm seed germination is a rather difficult process, not only to break dormancy, but also because it is long and often reaches lower-than-expected germination rates. Surprisingly, despite the crucial importance of germination for oil palm plantation management, our knowledge is still rather limited, in particular about germinating oil palm seed metabolism. The present review incorporates different pieces of information that have been obtained in the past few years, in oil palm and in other palm species, in order to provide an overview of germination metabolism and its control. Further insights can also be gained from other oleaginous model plants, such asArabidopsisor canola, however, palm seeds have peculiarities that must be accounted for, to gain a better understanding of germinating seed metabolism.

Putrescine has the potential to be a useful biomarker to reveal potassium (K+) deficiency. In fact, although this diamine has also been observed to increase during other stresses such as drought, cold or heavy metals, respective changes are comparably low. Due to its multifaceted biochemical properties, several roles for putrescine under K+ deficiency have been suggested, such as cation balance, antioxidant, reactive oxygen species mediated signalling, osmolyte or pH regulator. However, the specific association of putrescine build-up with low K+ availability in plants remains poorly understood, and possible regulatory roles must be consistent with putrescine concentration found in plant tissues. We hypothesize that the massive increase of putrescine upon K+ starvation plays an adaptive role. A distinction of putrescine function from that of other polyamines (spermine, spermidine) may be based either on its specificity or (which is probably more relevant under K+ deficiency) on a very high attainable concentration of putrescine, which far exceeds those for spermidine and spermine. putrescine and its catabolites appear to possess a strong potential in controlling cellular K+ and Ca2+, and mitochondria and chloroplasts bioenergetics under K+ stress.

This hinders the development of standardized fertilizer recommendations for this crop, as they are usually calculated based on optimum leaflet nutrient concentrations. Methods Four high-yielding oil palm progenies with contrasting leaflet K and Mg concentrations (C1, C2, and C3 of Deli x La Me origin and C4 of Deli x Yangambi origin) were treated with combinations of three levels of KCl and MgSO4, in a completely randomized split-plot factorial design with six replicates, where progenies were a sub-factor. Results For a given level of KCl or MgSO4, different leaflet K and Mg concentrations were found between progenies (p < 0.0001). Leaflet K concentration and yield response to KCl applications revealed that the four oil palm progenies have different optimum leaflet K concentrations. In our study period (5-8 YAP), progenies C1 and C3 showed their highest fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yields (13.62 and 16.54 t ha(-1) year(-1), respectively) at K2, whereas progenies C2 and C4 showed their highest yields (14.62 and 12.39 t ha(-1) year(-1), respectively) at K1. Conclusion Our study highlighted specific optimum leaflet K and Mg concentrations for different oil palm progenies in a given environment. It paves the way for adopting K and Mg fertilizer application rates adapted to specific requirements of each type of oil palm planting material.

The trial consisted of a completely randomized split-plot factorial design with six replicates, where progenies, considered as sub-factor were treated with combinations of 3 levels ofpotassium chloride (0, 1.5, 3.0 kg of KCl palm(-1) year(-1)) and kieserite (0, 0.75, 1.5 kg of MgSO4 palm(-1) year(-1))fertilizers (main factor), respectively. Growth characteristics differed significantly among progenies, but not in all studied years. In all progenies, KCl treatments significantly increased the average annual collar girth increment and projected canopy area. Adding 3.0 kg palm(-1) year(-1) of KCl significantly increased the total leaf area of progeny C4. Kieserite applications did not have an effect on progenies' growth characteristics whereas potassium showed to be the main mineral needed for oil palm growth. It was shown that with equal amounts of fertilizers applied, progeny C3 had better morphological traits than the other progenies, suggesting that the effective nutrient requirements should be assessed for each individual progeny and that fertilization should be adapted accordingly.

Four oil palm progenies representing a wide genetic diversity of Elaeis guineensis species and with contrasting K and Mg leaflet concentrations were tested in Indonesia and Nigeria, environments which differ predominantly in climate. During 5 years, we compared oil palm progenies' leaflet mineral concentrations between both countries under abundant fertilizer applications to investigate the extent to which they depend on the environment. In the two studied environments, leaflet concentrations significantly differed between progenies for K, Mg and Ca, but the country effect was not found significant (p = 0.352) for any leaflet mineral's concentration. In both countries, progenies ranked similarly in their mineral categories (lowest and highest cation concentrations within the 4 progenies population), indicating that leaflet mineral concentrations in the tested oil palm progenies are mainly determined by their genetic background. For each progeny, with abundant fertilization, K, Mg and Ca proportions to total leaf cation charge (TLCC) were similar, irrespective of the environments in which the palms were cultivated. We have strong indications that foliar concentrations of K, Mg and Ca are determined by genetic factors which dominate the environmental effect. However, it remains uncertain whether differences in oil palm foliar concentrations between different oil palm progenies imply that they require specific fertilizer amounts to attain an optimal production.

Leaf analyses (LA) were used for fertilization management as early as the 1950s. Leaf contents are compared to optimum references, making it possible to adjust the fertilizer rates applied in each block. Another approach, based on the nutrient balance (NB), is to evaluate and replace nutrients that are exported from the field, or immobilized by the plant. Plantations must adopt environmentally friendly practices; in particular, fertilizer inputs must be estimated with sufficient precision to achieve the highest possible yields, without applying excessive amounts of nutrients in relation to plant demand and the storage capacity of soils. We questioned the relevance of each method for achieving these objectives. We did so using some long-term fertilization trials to compare the optimum N and K rates recommended by each method in the adult phase. It appeared that LA led to moderate rates compared to NB. It also appeared that calculating a precise nutrient balance on a field scale was hampered by a lack of precise information (i) about the biomasses produced and their composition and (ii) about the highly variable outputs of the environmental losses. On the other hand, LA provided a simple indicator of the ability for each block to achieve its potential yield. We believe that this perfectible method is more protective of the environment, without the risk of a significant decrease in yields or a decrease in soil mineral reserves."

With more than 2,000 mm, the total annual rainfall is theoretically non-limiting but, with only 1,000 h, the total annual sunshine is well below the 1,800 h minimum recommended. Starting in the 1970s, the frequent occurrence of frond yellowing symptoms in the region became a recurrent worry for growers, convinced that they were facing the expression of a mineral deficiency. In this study, we used experimental results to examine the actual role of mineral nutrition in yellowing manifestation. We described the effects of two El Nino events (1982/1983 and 1997/1998) on climate variables and analysed their putative consequences on palm physiological functioning that could explain the observed foliage recovery. Our analysis led us to conclude that a direct mineral deficiency was not involved, as the soil reserves for the main nutrients were not to blame. We rejected the most frequently proposed hypothesis, whereby yellowing is caused by magnesium deficiency. Our study revealed the key role played by nitrogen, the best indicator of yellowing. Variations in N status appear to be linked to the same factors that determine the symptoms and we opted for the hypothesis of physiological disruption generated by low solar radiation levels under normal conditions. The study also reveals the need to consider specific optimum contents for N and Mg and to adjust fertilizer recommendations to local climate conditions.

Therefore, different researches are undergoing to evaluate the sustainability of ethanol production in different countries. This study aimed at analyzing the environmental performance of ethanol production in Ethiopia, considering energy balance and emission reduction using a life cycle assessment approach. It is also intended to identify the environmental hotspots so that possible improvement option can be devised. The life cycle assessment methodology was applied considering three alternative scenarios: 1) Base Case, which is the current situation, 2) Alternative 1, which considers the utilization of biogas from vinasse and bioslurry, and 3) Alternative 2, which includes mechanical harvesting and avoids pre-harvest cane trash burning. The results show that agricultural stage is greatly contributing to the pollutant emissions. The contribution of cane trash burning was significant to all the impact categories considered and avoiding pre-harvest cane trash burning significantly reduced the emissions contributing to global warming, acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, ozone formation, particulate matter and eutrophication. On the other hand, the introduction of mechanical harvesting to avoid pre-harvest cane trash burning increased ecotoxicity, human toxicity and resource consumption (land, water and mineral) impacts. The net energy balance is positive for all the alternatives considered. In addition to using by-products, proper management of fuel utilization at the agricultural stage can further enhance benefits from the sector. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the price of molasses highly influences both energy ratio and greenhouse gas emissions since it completely shifts the allocation of upstream emissions from sugar to molasses.

Among the many approaches available to assess soil quality, most of studies or monitoring programs consist in the measurement of stocks using an additive approach of physical, chemical and biological, parameters. More recently, functional methods have been developed to provide tools which better account the abioticbiotic interactions. The objective of our study was to evaluate and compare the capacity of physico-chemical, biological and functional parameters to assess the effect of land management on soil quality over a gradient of disturbance based on rubber tree plantations in Chachoengsao province, Thailand. Three sets of indicators were applied based on i. soil physico-chemical analyses, ii. biological analyses, based on soil free-living nematode indices iii. functional analyses, with Biofunctool (R) indicators linked to three main soil functions (carbon transformation, nutrient cycling, soil structure maintenance). A soil quality index resulting from the aggregation of each set of indicators into a single score showed that functional assessment was the most sensitive to the gradient of disturbance. Co-inertia analysis between sets revealed a significant relationship between functional analysis and both physico-chemical and biological sets of indicators, whereas the two latter were not related. Our results validated the ability of the functional method to better reflect the complexity of the abiotic-biotic interactions of the soil system.

TPD is associated with clonal susceptibility and overexploitation of rubber trees. Most studies are based on a binary point view of the absence or presence of TPD. This study sets out to characterize the dynamic of the TPD onset through the monthly monitoring of the dry cut length. This reveals the presence of dry spots on the tapped panel of any trees. The frequency of these dry spots increases dramatically in trees developing high level of TPD. Brown bast is an irreversible form of TPD. Brown bast is correlated to a high level of dry cut length. Application of an intensive harvesting system induces early TPD occurrence, which facilitates the study of TPD. Among latex diagnosis parameters, only sucrose content is significantly associated with TPD. Other parameters are more prone to environmental effects and are not reliable as physiological markers. These findings explain the contradictory conclusions of some papers. This study suggests to use intensive harvesting system and monitor the dry cut length for genetic analysis of TPD.

Natural rubber is synthesised in the rubber particles of laticifers. Latex diagnosis (LD) was established to characterise the physiological state of the laticiferous system by measuring its physiological parameters, i.e., sucrose, inorganic phosphorous (Pi), thiols and total solid content (TSC). Rubber clones are often classified in three groups i.e., quick starters, medium starters and slow starters. To better understand the genetic bases of latex yield, a biparental population was generated from a cross between the quick-starter clone PB 260 and the mediumstarter clone SP 217. LD was performed during the peak latex production season and used to calculate sucrose loading. The agronomic and physiological parameters associated with latex yield led to the classification of genotypes according to the rubber clonal typology and to the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) using a high-density map. Inorganic phosphorous content was positively associated with yield during the first year of production thus enabling identification of quick-starter clones. In addition, the LD-based clonal typology led to determine the long-term yield potential and the use of appropriate ethephon stimulation. QTL analysis successfully identified several QTLs related to yield, sucrose, Pi and TSC. One QTL related to sucrose loading was identified in the same position as the QTL for sucrose on linkage group 1. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report QTL analysis for this trait. The use of a high-density map enables the identification of genes underlying QTLs. Several putative genes underlying QTLs related to yield, sucrose and TSC were identified.

";10.1016/j.agsy.2023.103801;103801;WOS:001122450100001;NOV 2023;;;;;;;;CONTEXT: Oil palm smallholders often have difficulty implementing good agricultural practices and replanting, and tend to obtain low yields compared to corporate plantations. A frequent strategy to improve the sustain ability of smallholder production systems is sustainable intensification, aimed at increasing land productivity and farmers' incomes. To facilitate sustainable intensification, many leading public and private sustainability initiatives require farmers to join farmer organisations as a precondition for certification and assistance, with the objective of achieving advantages of scale. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to analyse the resilience of farmer organisations in the Ophir plantation when faced with replanting. We do so by linking actors, situations, and contexts relevant to collective action in five farmer cooperatives in Ophir over a 40-year period. Our aim is to offer unique insights into the enduring dynamics that influence the resilience of farmer organisations, shed light on smallholder oil palm replanting strategies, and draw several key lessons from this case.METHODS: Our findings are based on field visits by the lead author before, during and after replanting. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected to enable a holistic overview. During visits, 110 interviews with relevant stakeholders were recorded, project reports were collected, as were data on yields, costs, and other information on the functioning of the farming system. Analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery of the Ophir plantation and plantation inspections allowed us to further quantify replanting methods and replanting progress. A combined IAD-SES-NAS framework was used to structure findings and link variables, key events and context. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that farmer organisations can facilitate sustainable intensification in smallholder systems, but the resilience of farmer organisations proved diverse during replanting. Thus, farmer organisations are by no means a silver bullet for sustainable intensification. Landscape conditions, palm tree age, smallholder diversity and financial (mis)management play crucial roles in the resilience of farmer organisations and replanting strategies. Significant investment in various types of collective action is needed to encourage sustainable intensification through farmer organisations. SIGNIFICANCE: This article reports a rare holistic analysis of the bio-physical, socio-economic, and institutional aspects impacting collective action and replating in smallholder oil palm plantations. We present significant empirical data, which allows us to link 40 years of interactions between farmers, their institutions, plantations and changing contexts. Thereby we provide unique insights into farmer organisations, collective action and smallholder oil palm replanting.

In Sumatra, where more than 60% of Indonesian palm oil is cultivated, smallholders currently cover roughly 50% of the oil palm area. The rapid expansion of palm oil however did not happen without controversy. In current efforts by the Indonesian government, NGO's and private sector to improve sector performance, smallholders are often characterized as the Achilles heel of the oil palm sector due to poor practices and low yields compared to companies. However, 'oil palm smallholders' is a container concept and there has been only limited research into smallholder diversity beyond the organised versus independent farmer dichotomy. This research delves into the implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) among seven types of independent smallholders in Rokan Hulu regency, Riau province. The research area consisted of a relative established agricultural area on mineral soils and a relative frontier, mostly on peat. Smallholder types ranged from small local farmers to large farmers who usually reside in urban areas far from their plantation and regard oil palm cultivation as an investment opportunity. The underlying hypothesis is that larger farmers have more capital and therefore implement better agricultural practices than small farmers, who are usually more cash constrained. A wide range of methods was applied, including farmer and farm surveys, remote sensing, tissue analysis and photo interpretation by experts. These methods provided data on fertilizer use, nutrient conditions in oil palms, planting material, planting patterns, and other management practices in the plantations. Results show that yields are poor, implementation of GAP are limited and there is much room for improvement among all farmer types. Poor planting materials, square planting patterns, and limited nutrient applications were particularly prevalent. This implies that farmers across different typologies opt for a low-input low-output system for a myriad of reasons and that under current conditions, initiatives such as improving access to finance or availability of good planting material alone are unlikely to significantly improve the productivity and sustainability of the smallholder oil palm sector.

The reduced thiol content (RSH) is one of the biochemical parameters associated with the risk of TPD. However, RSH is difficult to interpret because of the influence of the environment. In order to better understand the regulation of antioxidants and to better interpret RSH, a key parameter of LD, this study analysed in latex both oxidised and reduced forms of ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione, and their cofactors as well as other latex diagnosis parameters in response to harvesting stress (tapping and ethephon stimulation) and TPD occurrence. The content of antioxidants in latex had a high variability among five rubber clones. The concentration in AsA was about ten times higher than GSH in laticifer, GSH accounting for about 50% of RSH. For short-term harvesting stress, RSH increased with tapping frequency and ethephon stimulation. TPD is associated with high latex viscosity and bursting of lysosomal par-ticles called lutoids, as well as for several rubber clones with lower RSH and GSH contents. These results suggest that a high level of RSH shows the capacity of laticifer metabolism to cope with harvesting stress, while a drop in RSH is the sign of long stress related to lower metabolic activity and TPD occurrence. RSH remains an essential physiological parameter to prevent TPD when associated with reference data under low and high harvesting stress. This study paves the way to understand the role of AsA and GSH, and carry out genetic studies of antioxidants.

";10.1111/sum.12922;;WOS:001022307700001;JUL 2023;;;;;;;;Cambodia has faced drastic agrarian changes over the last twenty years with a rapid and massive transformation of the uplands from forest into arable land. Soil quality depletion is one of the main drivers of the resulting decline in crop productivity and increasing production costs in the uplands of Battambang province. The objective of the study was to assess the early effects of conventional plough-based (20 cm) management (CT) and two conservation agriculture-based (CA) cropping systems (the use of a single-CAS vs. multiple cover crop species-CAM) on a maize monocropping system using three soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions on Mollisols in Battambang province. SOC content, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) and soil CO2 basal respiration through SituResp (R) were recorded at a depth of 0-10 cm. Twelve sampling periods were used over the growth period of the cover crops and during the maize cycle. POXC and SituResp (R) were highly sensitive to management practices with, across the 12 sampling periods, higher values (p < .05) under CA than CT, with an average increase of 6% and from 20% to 23%, respectively. No difference was observed in SOC content between the practices in our sampling periods. Seasonal variations were observed in both POXC and SituResp<(R)>. POXC underwent larger fluctuations following critical weather events than SituResp (R). This study showed that POXC and SituResp (R) were rapidly sensitive to changes in agricultural management practices. POXC and SituResp (R) are largely influenced by seasonality and could help clarify the impact of weather patterns on soil C dynamics.

Little is known about the effects of these crops on the nutritional status and growth of the palms in their immature phase even though the yield of adult palms can be affected by the management practices during this phase. The objective of this study was to evaluate the most common oil palm-based intercropping systems found in southern Benin in terms of nutritional status and growth of the palm. Within 15 oil palm farms, we compared 15 immature oil palm fields where the crop succession associated with the oil palms was dominated by maize, cassava, tomato, and pineapple. The nutrient concentrations in the soil and the palm leaves, and growth indicators were measured at the end of the immature phase. We found that the palm growth indicators were the lowest in the successions with pineapple. N and P nutrition of the immature palms was satisfactory but K was deficient in all systems, especially in those with pineapple. The K levels in the soils and palm leaves were correlated. Rough field budgets comparing the amounts of N and K applied to the crop successions with their N and K exports from non-returning products indicated that soil indigenous K supply would be particularly depleted in the systems with pineapple. We concluded that the young oil palms were affected by the competition for K exerted by the crop successions with pineapple even though they were the most fertilized in the region. The high profitable crop is therefore associated with the lowest growth rates of the immature palms. The mineral fertilizer management in these oil palm temporary intercropping systems should be improved.

Agroforestry is a form of agroecological intensification. Farmers in southern Benin are thus innovating in their oil palm groves, to cope with land and food pressures resulting from population growth. In order to support collective action in favor of sustainability, this study aims to identify the levers and constraints to the development of innovations underway in the oil palm groves of southern Benin, based on available knowledge of the socio-technical system, agronomic management and performance achieved. Methodologically, this knowledge is derived from research work involving regional agronomic and socio-technical diagnosis. In traditional systems where oil palms are randomly planted by landowners to produce palm wine, tenants increase the number of annual crop cycles by incorporating mineral and organic fertilization into their practices. In village systems, oil palm growers introduce various annual crops between immature oil palms to meet different objectives depending on the type of operation. The barriers to the development of these innovations are linked to incompatibilities between the visions and innovative strategies of the various stakeholders. In traditional systems, this divergence of vision leads to land conflicts between tenants and landowners, who notice a slowdown in palm growth and break land agreements, assuming that the tenants' practices deplete their soils. In village systems, the technical support provided by research and development actors is focused on prescriptive oil palm cultivation itineraries, while the farmers also need to reason out the fertilization of associated crops. Several perspectives for agroecological intensification are then discussed to support the agroecological transition of the Beninese oil palm sector."

However, linkages between practices, soil health and cropping system performance remain poorly disentangled. We assessed the relationships between soil health and cropping system performance for three maize-based cropping systems in New Caledonia. Two CA systems, one with direct seeding into a mixed species dead mulch (CA-DM) and one into a stylo living mulch (CA-LM), were compared to a conventional tillage (CT) system. CA vs. CT experiment started in 2011, whereas the differentiation between CA-DM and CA-LM was initiated in 2017 only. In 2018, soil health was evaluated using Biofunctool (R), a set of ten in-field tools that assess soil carbon transformation, structure maintenance and nutrient cycling functions. The performance of the three cropping systems were assessed by monitoring weeds, maize growth and yield components. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to disentangle the links between agricultural management, soil health and cropping system performance. Soil structure maintenance and nutrient cycling functions were higher under CA-DM and CA-LM than under CT, and carbon transformation function was higher under CA-DM than under CT and CA-LM. Overall, the soil health index (SHI) was 1.3-fold higher under CA systems than under CT. Cropping system management had both direct and indirect effects on soil functioning and crop productivity leading to a 1.3-fold higher yield under CA than under CT. The direct and indirect effects of CA systems on soil health had positive impacts on ecosystem services (i.e., productivity, weed regulation and soil ecosystem services). Such integrative approaches that account for the relationships and possible trade-offs between cropping system components enable a better understanding of the effects and the performance of practices, and support adaptive agricultural management.

";10.24259/fs.v4i1.8980;;WOS:000529065700012;;;162-180;;;;;;Since 2000, farmers in Northeast Thailand have planted more than 5,000 sq km of rubber on land previously devoted to agriculture. The expansion of rubber led to a significant increase in tree cover in Northeast Thailand. Rubber prices peaked in 2011 and since then farmers have had to adjust to lower prices. Little research has documented how farmers responded to low rubber prices. This paper seeks to describe how small-scale rubber farmers use fertilizer in a region that did not historically grow rubber during a period of low rubber prices. We collected data from structured interviews with 29 farmers in Subsomboon village in Khon Kaen province, Northeast Thailand. Most farmers reported that they reduced fertilizer costs by reducing the number of times they applied fertilizer, as well as changing to cheaper brands and/or using organic fertilizer. The majority of farmers still used large amounts of chemical fertilizers, either alone or in combination with commercial organic fertilizers with unknown nutrient contents. The N and P(2)O(5 )contents of the chemical fertilizer alone were consistent with national recommendations (82.0-137.6 kg N/ha/y and 33.3-97.7 kg P2O5/ha/y). Thai national recommendations for rubber, however, were developed for rubber plantations in traditional planting areas where rubber has been grown for over a century, and are considered by many experts to be high. The study's findings indicated that small scale rubber farmers would benefit from recommendations for fertilizer applications that respond to variations in rubber prices, while taking into account the diversity of individual household characteristics and goals. To optimize recommendations that sustain the growth and yield of rubber, limit the effects of environmental externalities, and maintain rubber's profitability, policymakers require detailed information on the diverse situations in which rubber is grown. This requires experimental research that tests a variety of fertilization practices under different biological and physical conditions.

One of the most common indices to monitor K fertilisation is K content (in % of DW, further noted as %K) in leaflets, typically used in foliar diagnosis (FD). However, uncertainty remains as to whether leaflets are always the most K-responsive organs and furthermore, implementing FD may require separate response curves for different soil and climatic conditions, and newly also i.e. genetic materials (progenies). As such, a universal K indicator ideally responsive to K availability and valid across many progenies could simplify FD. We investigated K responses of oil palm trees in four different progenies grown in North Sumatra, from planting to the maturation stage. Elemental analyses were performed along with biometrical measurements at tree scale, completed by data from agronomic databases. Uni-and multi-variate analyses were performed to identify the best indicators of K response. Tree K balance (difference between K availability and K needs) was computed to determine directly if (i) K supply met tree K demand and (ii) %K in leaflets, rachis or trunk were linked to the K budget. We also interrogate the accuracy of %K expression for K leaf content estimation and answer to it. Standard effects of K availability on height, leaf area, and yield were observed and varied mostly with the progeny. K balance cal-culations showed a systematic K imbalance when bunch production started, suggesting a non-negligible contribution of exchangeable soil K. %K in leaflets, rachis and trunk does not appear to be correlated with K balance. Our work brings out the important result that unlike %K in leaflets, phosphorus (P) and %K in rachis (more precisely %K symbolscript 3 %P) appeared to be tightly correlated with yield (FFB: fresh fruit bunches) two years later, suggesting a possible interdependence between fruits sink force and K-P elemental content in leaves. Since this indicator is under important genetic effect, we propose to use the combination of mineral contents generated by multivariate analysis, which successfully predicts FFB after two years, independently of the progeny.

We present the results of a fertilizer trial during the immature phase of a rubber plantation setup in Cambodia. The main objective of this study was to analyze the response of a specific clone, PB330, in the specific conditions of one of the most important rubber-growing areas of Cambodia. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with 4 treatments and 4 replications. The four treatments consisted of 3 fertilization treatments with an increasing dose of fertilizers (respectively T1, T2 and T3) compared to a non-fertilized control (T0). The girth of trees was measured every six months from the end of the first year after planting (YAP) to the end of the 6th YAP. Results showed that fertilization had a significant effect on tree girth. At the end of the 6th YAP, fertilization had a significant effect on the number of tappable trees, and stand basal area but not on average tree girth. The most pronounced effect of fertilization was observed from annual increments in girth and stand basal area during the 3rd and 4th YAP. The effect of fertilization on tree growth was evident from all three treatments, although T3 gave the most significant increase compared to T0, increasing doses of fertilizer did not significantly improve the growth parameters. Hence, this study confirmed the importance of mineral nutrition on rubber tree growth during the immature phase even at T1, the lowest level of nutrient inputs. These results can be used to improve the standard fertilizer recommendations for immature rubber trees in Cambodia. We recommend setting up similar trials in different edaphic conditions of the country with the aim to establish nutrient management practices tailored to local biophysical constraints.

Nevertheless, performance and especially the percentage of each species at harvest are often considered highly variable. Nitrogen (N) fertilisation can be a relevant driving factor affecting the percentage of each species at harvest. Soil N availability influences competition for light and nitrogen in cereal-legume intercrops. However, management of N fertilisation still remains unclear for intercrops. Few references on the effects of a range of strategies of N fertilisation are available to guide farmers with relevant decision rules considering their expectations. Here, a modelling approach was proposed to simulate interactions between light and N acquisition of a pea-wheat intercrop and to test different scenarios for the management of such intercrops. A model (Azodyn-IC) was built resulting from the combination of two existing individual-crop models (AZODYN and AFISOL) and by applying rules of light and soil inorganic nitrogen sharing between the intercropped pea and wheat. Evaluation of the model outputs with experimental data showed satisfactory predictions of the studied variables (N accumulation, LAI, and crop dry weight). The model validated both resource sharing and light-N interactions. Furthermore, the model was able to respond to increases in inorganic N availability based upon straightforward formalisms. Simulating unmeasured variables, such as root growth and light interception and use by each species, improved our understanding of the relative dominance of each species for acquiring resources. Eventually, the model was used to simulate different scenarios of N fertilisation over 26 years of climatic data to account for climatic variability. We demonstrated the interest of such a modelling approach to design decision rules of N fertilisation according to farmers' expectations.

Among those, ex-plasma smallholders are characterized by the fact that they only start to manage their own plantations 5 to 10 years after those were initially planted and managed by a partner industrial company. Despite the large areas that are cultivated by ex-plasma smallholders, their diversity of practices and economic performances are poorly quantified. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims at investigating which smallholder farming systems optimize profitability at the plot scale. METHOD: We defined two typologies, one based on agricultural practices and the other based on economic performance, using multivariate statistical analysis. The typologies were crossed to understand the links between agricultural practices and economic performance at the plot level. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that despite initial plot homogeneity during planting phase, ex-plasma smallholders can develop very diversified management practices. A gradient of intensification was observed from farmers implementing no fertilization or weeding management up to farmers following agroindustrial-like management. Economic performances at the plot level was found to be variable, with gross margins ranging from 1.1 to 26.9 M IDR.ha- 1.yr-1 (eq. 66.4 to 1625.5 euro ). We showed that the most intensive practices led to highest yields although these were not linked to the optimal economic plot performances. A trade-off based on input costs was revealed, as high fertilization practices did not seem economically optimal for smallholders. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study highlights the need to combine quantified agronomic assessments with eco-nomic analysis, to properly design recommendations to farmers.

Its benefit for enhancing soil functioning is rarely studied. We studied soil health in a 25 years temperate agroforestry plot cultivated with barley (Hordeum vulgare) according to two factors: i. the position to the tree row; and ii. the tree species. Soil health was assessed in three positions (in the tree row; in the crop alley next to the tree row and at 6.5 m from the tree row), for three contrasted tree species (Acer monspessulanum, Fraxinus sp., Pyrus communis) using two integrative methods based on soil biological activity (Biofunctool (R), MicroRespTM). The position factor explained soil health differences the best: mean indexes were found 1.6 times higher in the tree row than in both positions in the crop alley, especially the structure maintenance function was impacted (indexes in the tree row = 0.21 to 0.26; indexes in the crop alley = 0.11 to 0.17). Tree species had less impact on soil health and impacted only carbon dynamics and microbial catabolic profiles. Our study invites to consider spatial organization and tree species to optimize soil ecosystem services in agroforestry systems."

Presently, monitoring K fertilization is difficult since it depends on soil properties, crosses and other nutrients. To adjust K fertilization precisely during cultivation, leaf biomarkers that can indicate changes in tree K status before the appearance of symptoms on fruit production and yield, are required. However, the metabolic response of oil palm leaves to K availability is poorly documented. Here, we investigated the response of oil palm leaf metabolome and proteome to K availability in two crosses (Deli x La Me, and Deli x Yangambi) grown in the field. Our result show that one to two years only after the onset of K fertilization treatments, there were changes in N metabolism, photosynthesis and mitochondrial metabolism, with a differential effect in the two crosses. In particular, there were changes in sugars, amino and organic acids pointing to modifications in photosynthetic and catabolic (Krebs cycle) capacity and this agreed with the effect seen on enzyme content. Therefore, K availability led to rapid changes in leaf primary metabolism, opening avenues for the utilization of leaf metabolic signature as a marker of K nutrition in oil palm.

However, its effects on fruit oil content and composition are not well documented. Here, we conducted bunch, metabolomics, and oil composition analyses in two contrasting crosses (Deli x La Me and Deli x Yangambi) grown under different K fertilization conditions. K availability impacted bunch oil content, resulting in lower water content and higher oil proportion in fruit mesocarp, in Deli x La Me only, thus showing differential responses of crosses to K. Oil composition at maturity did not significantly change under low K conditions despite clear alterations in fruit metabolism associated with lipid production during maturation, demonstrating the resilience of oil biosynthetic metabolism. However, the analysis of variance in oil content (across K treatments and crosses) demonstrates that sugar availability, lipid synthesis rates, and metabolic recycling are all important in determining the oil content.

It is based on worldwide scientific knowledge and built using data from three municipalities of Tolima department in Colombia. Fuzzy logic is used in a multicriteria decision making framework in two different ways. First, fuzzy sets are used to model an expert preference relation for each of the individual information sources to turn raw data into satisfaction degrees. Second, fuzzy rules are used to model the interaction between sources to aggregate the individual degrees into a global score. The whole framework is implemented as an open source software called GeoFIS. A part of the data was used for calibration, then the remaining data served as a validation set. The results were easy to analyze and in agreement with field observations. The output inferred by the fuzzy inference system was used as a target to learn the weights of classical numerical aggregation operators. Only the Choquet Integral proved to have a similar modeling ability, but its optimal tuning would have been difficult without learning.

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of how Thai family farms responded to that continuous decrease in rubber prices. The originality of this work was to combine a farming system approach for decision making with the sustainable rural livelihoods' framework for resource endowment and strategies to benefit from the complementarities of these two theoretical approaches. An existing database was used characterizing the rubber farms and farmers' practices in 2011 when the rubber price was at its maximum. A subsample of farmers was interviewed again in 2017 after six years of price decreases to characterize the new situation and to identify and explain the changes. Fifteen flexibility mechanisms to face the crisis were implemented at three different levels: rubber cropping system, farming system and activity system. Combinations of these mechanisms identified eight strategies of adaptation to the crisis, classified on the reversibility of the changes. Three major types of strategies were identified: (i) reversible adjustments at the level of activity system variables, (ii) mobilization of available production factors to be invested in an activity that allows, over a longer time perspective, compensation for the disturbances caused by the crisis. This type of adaptation was reversible, but its implementation expressed motivation in the medium and long terms; (iii) reallocation of the production factors already mobilized at the level of the rubber cropping system toward other activities, to compensate the disturbances caused by the crisis. This last type induced a deeper transformation in the distribution of the production factors in the activity system and was anchored in a long-term vision. The first type corresponded to a dynamics of disturbances absorption to maintain the smallholders' systems and overcome the crisis; the two other types corresponded to dynamics of compensation with more or less reversible changes. Overall, this study confirmed the capacity of adaptation of family agriculture when facing shocks. It also showed that the flexibility of these households relied greatly on rubber cropping systems through possible technical change and through the adaptation of the share-tapping labor contract. This highlighted the importance of considering farmers' practices (and changes of practices) to understand their strategies."

The properties and mesostructure of dry natural rubber depend on several factors during coagula maturation. This work investigated an experimental design allowing concomitant control of several factors during maturation of cup coagula, namely, temperature, relative humidity, atmosphere, vertical weight, coagulation conditions, clone, and maturation duration. For each combination of factors, several indicators were measured. They dealt with the coagula (thickness, DRCcoag), with the dry rubber (physical properties (P-0, PRI, ASHT), and the mesostructure (Gel(>1 mu), M-n, M-w, M-z). Statistical treatment of the results (recursive partition) led to a hierarchical ranking of factors for each measured indicator. The first-ranked parameter was coagulation mode followed by genotype (clone) or maturation duration, temperature, or weight application. The provided identification of the most important drivers occurring during coagula maturation could allow improvements of the post-harvest operational handling aiming at a better control of the variability of produced natural rubber properties.

Therefore, coagula made from 3 different coagulation modes (sulfuric acid, formic acid, and natural coagulations) with different maturation durations (0, 2, 9, 16, 30, and 44 days) were studied. The mesostructure of NR samples was analyzed using SEC-MALS on wet coagula and on wet and dry crepes. For wet coagula coagulated with acids, only Mz and Mw decreased slightly with maturation time, while Mn and Gel>1 mu had no significant evolution during maturation. On the other hand, for wet coagula after natural coagulation, all mesostructure indicators evolved significantly with maturation time. The results showed that structuration increased along maturation time, generating microaggregates with larger size and more structured macrogel inside wet coagula after natural coagulation. This study found that creping process (comparison of wet coagula and wet crepes) had only a moderate effect on the structuration of NR samples. However, the drying process (comparison of wet and dry crepes) had an important effect on the structuration of rubber, especially for natural coagulation and formic acid coagulation. Coagulation with sulfuric acid appeared to slow down the phenomena related to the structuration of microaggregates and macrogel.

However, oil palm cultivation faces important challenges such as adverse climatic conditions, expensive fertilization requirements, and fungal pathogens, including Ganoderma. Intense efforts in oil palm breeding are devoted to improving both oil production yield and resistance to environmental cues. Metabolomics can be of interest because it provides many quantitative traits and metabolic signatures that can be selected for to optimize oil palm performance. Here, we briefly review how metabolomics can help oil palm breeding, and to do so, we give examples of recent metabolomics analyses and provide a roadmap to use metabolomics-assisted breeding.

Bibliometric analysis of research outputs reveals a distinct imbalance in the type of research being undertaken, notably a disproportionate focus on biofuel and engineering topics. Recognizing the expansion of oil palm agriculture across the tropics and the increasing awareness of environmental, social, and economic impacts, we seek to reorientate the existing research agenda toward one that addresses the most fundamental and urgent questions defined by the palm oil stakeholder community. Following consultation with 659 stakeholders from 38 countries, including palm oil growers, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and researchers, the highest priority research questions were identified within 13 themes. The resulting 279 questions, including 26 ranked as top priority, reveal a diversity of environmental and social research challenges facing the industry, ranging from the ecological and ecosystem impacts of production, to the livelihoods of plantation workers and smallholder communities. Analysis of the knowledge type produced from these questions underscores a clear need for fundamental science programmes, and studies that involve the consultation of non-academic stakeholders to develop ""transformative"" solutions to the oil palm sector. Stakeholders weremost aligned in their choice of priority questions across the themes of policy and certification related themes, and differed the most in environmental feedback, technology and smallholder related themes. Our recommendations include improved regional academic leadership and coordination, greater engagement with private and public stakeholders in Africa, and Central and South America, and enhanced collaborative efforts with researchers in the major consuming countries of India and China."

However, no study of the long-term effect of rubber plantations on soil biodiversity has been carried out yet. This study aimed to assess the long-term impact of continuous rubber monocropping on soil biodiversity, focusing on soil macrofauna and nematode diversity. Three successive rubber rotations at young and old ages were compared with the adjacent forest in Suratthani province, Thailand. Soil biodiversity quality index was calculated from a set of indicators which were combined into a single score to present a functional assessment of the gradient of disturbance. The results showed three negative effects on soil biodiversity (i) the biodiversity quality index immediately declined after deforestation (ii) the old age rubber plantations had a lower soil biodiversity as the nematodes were a main driver of diversity in the young plantation, and (iii) similarly, for the soil chemical properties, the long-term effect of rubber chronosequence evidenced deterioration in the third rotation. Therefore, two rotations of rubber plantation (around 50 years) seemed to be the maximum length of rubber monocropping in terms of soil biodiversity recovery.

In historical producing regions like South Thailand, rubber has been planted by smallholders for three successive rotations lasting a total of 75 years. Despite possible consequences on topsoil, the long-term impacts of repeated rubber plantations on soil quality remain unknown. This study aims to better understand how various factors linked to long-term rubber land use and land use change affect topsoil physico-chemical properties and soil organic carbon (SOC) thermal stability. We focus on the effects of three factors: i. deforestation (change from forest to first rubber plantation); ii. the age of the rubber stand (immature vs. mature); and iii. long-term rubber cultivation (first, second or third successive rotation) over a chronosequence in farmers plots. Our results show that soil was deeply degraded after deforestation to a rubber plantation. Long-term rubber cultivation is also detrimental for the soil and has a more negative impact on soil physico-chemical properties and carbon dynamics, than the age of the rubber stand (e.g., on average, decrease of 50% of SOC content between forest and third rotation). At the third rotation, after 50 years of rubber cultivation, the quality of the 0-10 cm soil layer was very low, with an increase in SOC thermal stability. At this stage, logging practices upset the sustainability of the system. These impacts could be limited by less destructive practices during planting."

Addition of nitrogen (N) via legume cover crop and fertilizers is a common practice in industrial oil palm plantations, however, there is a tendency for N loss, thus contributing significantly to environmental effects. To improve the sustainability of palm oil production, it is crucial to determine which management practices minimize N losses. Continuous field measurements would be cost-prohibiting as a monitoring tool, and in the case of oil palm, available models do not account for all the potential nitrogen inputs and losses or management practices. In this context, we developed IN-Palm, a model to help managers and scientists estimate N losses to the environment and identify best management practices. The main challenge was to build the model in a context of knowledge scarcity. Given these objectives and constraints, we developed an agri-environmental indicator, using the INDIGO method and fuzzy decision trees. We validated the N leaching module of IN-Palm against field data from Sumatra, Indonesia. IN-Palm is implemented in an Excel file and uses 21 readily available input variables to compute 17 modules. It estimates annual emissions and scores for each N-loss pathway and provides recommendations to reduce N losses. IN-Palm predictions of N leaching were acceptable according to several statistics, with a tendency to underestimate nitrogen leaching. Thus, we highlighted necessary improvements to increase IN-Palm precision before use in plantations.

Nitrogen may also be an ecological limiting factor in freshwater systems, but commonly not modelled. This work aims at filling this gap by consistently developing fate factors (FFs) for both dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), using the same underlying model of nutrient export by rivers. Methods The present FFs were developed for application to both diffuse emissions from soil and point emissions of nutrients to freshwater. The fate processes modelled include nutrient attenuation from land to stream, in the river network, in artificial reservoirs and lakes and associated with water consumption. FFs were calculated at a river basin resolution with a global coverage and at the country and global scales by means of emission-weighting aggregation and distinguishing agricultural from non-agricultural emissions. Results and discussion River basin-scale FFs range from 7.7 x 10(-8) to 330 days for N emissions and from 3.0 x 10(-8) to 520 days for P emissions. Fate factors are aggregated at country and global scale with applicability at such scales in mind. Global average FFs (in days) are FFsoil Nglobal = 125; FFfw N global = 257; FFsoil P global = 23; FFfw P global = 247. Comparison of FFs calculated at various scales showed the importance of using FFs at the highest spatial resolution (i.e. river basin). However, the river basin resolution may be too coarse for certain large basins as demonstrated for the Waikato basin in New Zealand, where FFs calculated at the sub-basin scale varied significantly. The characterisation factors represent the potential contribution of N and P to freshwater eutrophication (in N-eq and P-eq). The N and P components can be aggregated into a single indicator expressed in ""algae-equivalent"" for co-limited catchments or when the limitation status is unknown. The present fate model for freshwater eutrophication is consistent with and complements recent advances in marine eutrophication impact assessment. Conclusion Applying these FFs in conjunction with a spatially explicit inventory data of N and P emissions may improve the environmental relevance of freshwater eutrophication impact assessment in LCA. One limitation is the focus on dissolved N and P, as highlighted by a comparison of attenuation factors with a New Zealand-specific hydrological model. The inclusion of particulate and organic N and P from NEWS2 should be part of future freshwater eutrophication FF developments."

The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the implications of nitrogen emission limitations on eutrophication and climate change impacts of NZ beef through its life cycle to a European market and uniquely link it to 2) estimation of the reduction in these impacts that can be funded by the consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for a low environmental-impact product. Method: The cradle-to-market Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of NZ beef on the European market included beef production on farms, meat processing, packaging and transport stages. Various beef production systems in the Lake Taupd region were modelled: farm systems with and without regulated N leaching limits in place (using N fertiliser inputs of 0 and 100 kg N/ha/year respectively) using suckler beef or beef derived from surplus calves from a dairy farm. The FARMAX model was used to model farm productivity and profitability under these various scenarios, whereas the OVERSEER (R) model was used to model field/farm emissions (N, phosphorus (P)) and the NZ greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventory model was used to estimate total GHG emissions. Eutrophication and climate change impacts of NZ beef to the European market were calculated using recent regionalised LCA indicators. We estimated freshwater and marine eutrophication impacts of European beef using published N emissions to water and air. We estimated the European consumer's WTP for beef with positive environmental attributes based on a meta-regression analysis based on 21 published studies and compared farmer's profit for the farm system scenarios. Results: When using common P-driven eutrophication indicators, the farms using 100 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year appeared to have a lower freshwater eutrophication impact than farms using no N fertiliser, which is in contradiction with the local freshwater policy for N regulations. When the contribution of both N and P were accounted for, the farms using no N fertiliser had the lowest estimated impact Comparison with published environmental footprint of beef from Europe showed lower climate change and eutrophication impacts for NZ beef, thus showing potential positive environmental attributes for NZ beef. The European consumer's WIP (32% price premium) for such a beef product with low environmental impacts could offset the cost to farmers for implementing the reduction of N emissions. Conclusions: Bridging the gap between local freshwater policy and LCA indicators starts by considering both P and N emissions and impacts. Combining an environmental LCA with an economic analysis revealed that the consumer willingness to pay could compensate for the environmental cost of protecting the lake that currently only the farmers are bearing.

The aim of this project was to show how smallholder rubber plantations can adapt and remain sustainable in the face of variable climatic conditions and deep changes in socio-economic context. Among the various types of cropping systems, agroforestry practices were identified as promising. Rubber agroforestry systems (AFS) are economically more productive than rubber monocrop plantations and give more flexibility to smallholders, in particular when rubber prices are low, which has been the case since 2013. However, adoption of AFS during the mature period of the plantations is very low in Thailand. The policy to boost rubber agroforestry practices still needs to be developed with all local stakeholders. The objectives of the study were to identify the possibilities and capacities to use current AFS dynamic networks as a basis to set up a rubber agroforestry innovation platform. The research team studied: i) farmers' collective organizations, groups or networks with rubber AFS partially or entirely and ii) the social dynamic enabling the sharing of knowledge and know-how. An individual producer's grid, with original farmers or strong knowledge with ease of sharing, was also studied. The role of local institutions involved in the promotion of rubber AFS was also analyzed. This allowed us to design an innovation platform and to define activities that suit the socio-economic context of Phatthalung province. The main aims of the platform are to promote cooperation among innovative producers and the transmission between them of knowledge and know-how about rubber AFS. This could an efficient tool that Thai rubber institutions could set up to encourage the adoption of rubber AFS by farmers."

This paper builds on ICID's 2030 vision on a more sustainable irrigation sector. It recaps the various environmental impacts of irrigation systems and calls for a threefold paradigm shift: the objectives of irrigation, its practices, and the ways to assess its impacts must evolve. The paper critically analyses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs') framework, which provides a prompting set of orientations, yet with little consideration of the systemic nature of irrigation. The paper promotes more operational frameworks: nexus thinking and the ecosystem services' framework, since both allow for systemic approaches, and for developing trade-offs. The paper also discusses the merits of life cycle analysis (LCA) for environmental impact assessment. The benefits gained through these alternative approaches are illustrated in two cases of environmental impacts: return flow and salinization. Finally, the paper suggests combining these approaches with three principles for fostering a true paradigm shift in agricultural water use: developing and using suitable metrics, combining models to reconnect economic concerns with environmental ones, and considering larger territories and ecosystems to cater for interactions with the environment.

On tree plantations, clear-cutting and land preparation between two crop cycles cause severe physical disturbances to the soil and seriously deplete soil organic carbon and biodiversity. Rubber, one of the main tropical perennial crops worldwide, has a plantation life cycle of 25 to 40 years, with successive replanting cycles on the same plot. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of clear-cutting disturbance on three soil functions (carbon transformation, nutrient cycling and structure maintenance) and their restoration after the planting of the new rubber crop, in two contrasting soil situations (Arenosol and Ferralsol) in Cote d'Ivoire. In this 18-month diachronic study, we intensively measured soil functions under different scenarios as regards the management of logging residues and the use or not of a legume cover crop. We investigated the relationship between soil macrofauna diversity and soil heath. At both sites, clear-cutting and land preparation disturbed carbon transformation and nutrient cycling significantly and, to a lesser extent, structure maintenance function. When logging residues were applied, carbon transformation and structure maintenance functions were fully restored within 12 to 18 months after disturbance. By contrast, no restoration of nutrient cycling was observed over the study period. A legume cover crop mainly improved the restoration of carbon transformation. We found a strong relationship (P <= 0.001; R-2 = 0.62-0.66) between soil macrofauna diversity and soil health. Our overall results were very similar at the two sites, despite their contrasting soil conditions. Keeping logging residues in the plots and sowing a legume in the inter-row at replanting accelerated the restoration of soil functions after major disturbance caused by clear-cutting and land preparation. Our results confirm the necessity of taking soil macrofauna diversity into account in the management of tropical perennial crops. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It has become a major concern in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations introduced on sloping ground. Alternative agroecological crop management practices must be investigated. One aim of our study was to assess the ability of logging residues (i. e., trunks, branches, leaves and stumps of a clearcut plantation) and of legume cover (Pueraria phaseoloides) to mitigate N, P and K losses through runoff and soil detachment in a young rubber plantation. The other aim was to investigate the relationships of these nutrient losses with soil structure and soil macrofauna diversity. Runoff and soil loss were monitored for 3 years using 1-m2 plots under different practices as regards the management of logging residues and the use or not of a legume. The monitoring started when rubber trees were one-year-old. The planting row, where soil was bare, was the hotspot of soil erosion, with an average runoff of 832 mm y-1 and soil loss of 3.2 kg m- 2 y-1. Sowing a legume in the inter -row reduced runoff and soil loss by 88 % and 98 % respectively, compared to bare soil. Spreading logging residues as well as growing a legume cover almost eliminated runoff and soil detachment (19 mm y-1 and 4 g m- 2 y-1 respectively). Nutrient losses were negligible as long as the soil surface was covered by a legume crop, with or without logging residues. Total N loss from soil detachment ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 g m- 2 y-1, for example. Spreading logging residues in the inter -rows significantly improved soil structure and soil macrofauna diversity compared to bare soil. Nutrient losses from runoff and soil detachment were negatively correlated with improved soil structure and soil macrofauna diversity. We recommend investigating alternative ways to manage planting rows.

The area occupied by rubber plantations rose from 3.9 million ha in 1961 to 12.5 million ha in 2018. Both the expansion of rubber plantations in marginal zones (prone to biotic and abiotic stress), and long-term rubber tree cultivation in traditional areas, raise questions about the sustainability of NR production in a context of climate change. Our study set out to gain insights into the biogeochemical cycles in rubber plantations, for a better matching of fertilizer inputs to the dynamics of nutrient demand throughout rubber tree growth. Nutrient accumulation in tree biomass is a major component of the biological cycle in tree plantations. We studied the dynamics of biomass and nutrient accumulation in two chronosequences covering the whole lifespan of a plantation in Ivory Coast managed on a sandy soil at the SAPH site, and one on a clayey soil at the SOGB site. In total, 56 trees were destructively sampled in 2-, 5-, 20- and roughly 40-year-old stands. While the use of allometric relationships is common for estimating nutrient stocks in planted forests, this study was the first to provide allometric equations predicting nutrient stocks in rubber tree components. Allometric models were applied to the inventory of 4 commercial stands, for each age at each site, to estimate stand biomass and nutrient stocks. The current annual increments of nutrient stocks in tree biomass peaked between 2 and 5 years after planting. They reached 80 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for N, 14 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for P and 34 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for K at SAPH (53, 7, and 39 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively at SOGB), which highlighted the importance of an appropriate fertilization schedule for young rubber trees. At the clear-cut age (38-40 years), the amounts of nutrients accumulated in tree biomass were 970 kg N ha(-1), 188 kg P ha(-1), 366 kg K ha(-1), 941 kg Ca ha(-1) and 255 kg Mg ha(-1) on the sandy soil at SAPH (907,118, 629 1499, and 375 kg ha(-1) respectively on the clayey soil at SOGB). Contrasting soil properties and management practices at the two sites had a much greater effect on the amounts of P, K, Ca and Mg accumulated in the trees than on N accumulation. Logging practices in rubber plantations can lead to considerable nutrient exports on poor tropical soils. Harvest residues should be distributed uniformly in the plots so that the roots of young trees can quickly gain access to the nutrients released during decomposition.

However, there is still a lack of integrative studies that assess the overall impact of CA on soil health. To fill the gap, Biofunctooll (R), a set of in-field indicators, was developed to monitor changes in soil biological functioning. In this study, Biofunctool (R) was used to assess the impact of a conventional tillage (CT) and three CA annual-based cropping systems on soil health on a Cambodian Oxisol. Eight indicators related to the three soil functions were monitored and integrated into a Soil Quality index (SQI), i.e. the Biofunctool (R) Index. Overall, we found that soil health was twice higher under the CA treatments than under CT treatment. Although it was similar in the three CA treatments, the contribution of each soil function to the soil health diverged. An analysis of soil carbon dynamics also showed that CA support short-term soil organic carbon stabilization compared to CT. This study demonstrates that Biofunctool (R) is a robust, relevant, time-and cost-effective in-field assessment tool that can be used in multiple ways including cropping system management, capacity building of local stakeholders, and policy dialogue.

Mixed-tree forests can provide habitat in a context of industrial agriculture, as pioneer tree species are efficient in restoring healthy riparian forests and providing shelter for wildlife. Biodiversity corridors also contribute to climatic resilience, as agroforestry systems can mitigate climate change through the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in plants and soil. Mixed plantations also improve livelihoods: it is key to understand ecosystems services and wellbeing values attributed by local communities to the reforestation of riparian areas and the transition from monoculture plantations toward mixed-planted systems. TRAILS objective is to install oil-palm-based agroforestry systems, using selected oil palm seedlings and native forest tree species grown in locally run village nurseries. The project also aims at monitoring the dynamics of recolonization by wildlife in areas covered with mixedplanting, riparian corridors, and oil palm plantations. The project monitors the agronomic performance of oil palms planted under agroforestry designs. TRAILS also aims at understanding key characters of climate resilience through the monitoring of bioclimatic condition of the parcels and their ability to provide environmental services. TRAILS builds on a complementary partnership, linking academic, NGOs, private and public stakeholders, thus enabling integrated approaches arising from various science fields, from agronomy and forestry to veterinary sciences, including a detailed socioeconomic approach."

Perpetuating agricultural systems inherited from the colonial era (a time of abundant arable land, protected markets, and cheap and disciplined labour) will not be enough to prepare these sectors in facing immediate crucial challenges unless substantial structural transformations are made.Implementing a successful agroecological transition in a 70-billion USD sector, covering 25 million ha worldwide, calls for drastic changes in mind-sets and practices. The key issue is no longer simply to increase productivity, but to foster innovations designed to support endangered tropical biodiversity, while providing a decent living for shrinking agricultural communities in the Global South.Agroforestry practices have a role to play in providing substantial climate change mitigation with an impact comparable to other climate-focused solutions, such as reforestation. The expected contribution of oil palm-based agroforestry relies on agro-environmental services, as basic agricultural functions such as soil preservation, pollination, or pest control can be ensured by living organisms inside and around the plantation. Diversified systems are able to achieve both economic and environmental gains, as they use land more efficiently than monocultures. Building on regenerative agriculture, new plantation designs are emerging and deserve to be thoroughly assessed to establish evidence-based advocacy for change.

A performance trial with 10 clones was set up in 2006 in such an escape zone in Ecuador with non-American clones whose high production potential is acknowledged elsewhere in the world, some of which are recommended on a commercial scale. Production results over seven years, between 2013 and 2019, indicated a very high potential for this material in this new region, reaching average yields of 2.5 t/ha/year for clones PB 280, PB 312 and PB 314, and 1.85 t/ha/year for the control clone RRIM 600, despite a very pronounced 5-month dry season. However, the risks of wind damage and tapping panel dryness were found to be very high for PB 312 and PB 314. Clone PB 280 proved to perform best overall, with 93% of trees in production and one of the lowest Tapping Panel Dryness (TPD) rates. This clone, distinguished by its medium high latex metabolism and a high sucrose reserve, presents a highly promising alternative for the cultivation of rubber trees in escape zones. This is particularly relevant in situations where the phytosanitary risk associated with P. ulei is constrained.

Appropriate management, including the inter-rows, is essential for the long-term viability, and productivity of the plantation while reducing the length of the unproductive period. Despite its significant economic and environmental impacts, the immature period is still poorly characterized and rarely included in the assessment of perennial cropping systems sustainability. Rubber plantations are an interesting case, as a major perennial system in the tropics. Here we conducted a systematic review to identify (1) management practices in inter-rows of immature rubber plantations; (2) the variables used in the literature to analyze the adoption drivers of these practices and to assess their effects on plantation functionalities and performances; and (3) the main effects of diversification practices on plantation functionalities and performances. The major results showed that (1) different inter-row management practices, including a diversity of crops, are possible during the immature period; (2) adoption of diversification practices is driven by few global factors but mostly depends on the specific socio-economic and agroecological context; (3) diversification practices are usually assessed with respect to agronomic and economic performances, and their impacts are generally positive. We identified missing knowledge required for a comprehensive view on current inter-row management practices in immature rubber plantations. First, technical operations should be included in the characterization and assessment of inter-row management practices. Second, a multicriteria assessment framework is required to cover all the sustainability dimensions to guarantee the diffusion of more performant management practices. In order to include the diversity of perceptions of sustainability in rubber plantations, this multicriteria assessment should be based on relevant criteria that combine farmers' and scientists' points of view. Detailed characterization of current immature rubber plantations merged with multicriteria assessment will be essential for the design of more sustainable rubber tree cropping systems."

Spectral libraries can be used with the purpose of assessing soil condition by measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) or increasing productivity through soil nutrient management. A spectral library was generated by measuring SOC and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) and spectral reflectance data over the visible to near-infrared range (350-2,500 nm) in soil samples collected from four production systems in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The spectral library was analysed using SpecOptim, a software tool developed at the James Hutton Institute to explore spectral pre-processing and calibration options. From 192 model combinations of model, the best one was identified for each study area. Different combinations of data were also explored (e.g. by farm or all together). We believe that at the local-scale, soil carbon and nitrogen variability can be captured; however, the spectrally inactive properties such as phosphorous and potassium need to have a higher variability and therefore pooling is required in order to predict properties chemometrically. The SpecOptim software is a useful tool where analysis of spectral data can be difficult to determine. Specifically, it helped improve the accuracy of predictions by 2% for C and N (except for East New Britain site) compared with previously used pre-processing techniques and calibration models while automating identification of the optimal pre-processing approach. We believe that we have developed research-based evidence for using spectral libraries to fit with the soil priority areas of PNG."

Soil under cacao trees in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is fertile, however, it's been identified that to sustainably reach a production goal of 310,000 t by 2030, PNG needs soil-based recommendations. For this purpose, a cost-effective, rapid and non-invasive soil testing approach using near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (NIR-DRS), to cater for soil testing needs of numerous small landholdings was assessed. This study investigated whether spectral data collected from smallholder farms across provinces can be used to estimate soil conditions for cacao farming. To assess this, a spectral library was generated by measuring 17 different soil parameters and spectral reflectance data over visible to near-infrared region (350-2500 nm) in 507 soil samples collected from four production systems in Autonomous region of Bougainville (AroB), New Ireland province (NIP), East New Britain province (ENB) and East Sepik province (ESP). Analysis of spectral data showed that the shallow limestone soil of NIP is dominantly montmorillonite mixed with kaolinite clay minerals, while the three other sampling sites are mostly vermiculite with mixed illite type of clay. Among Cubist, partial-least-square regression (PLSR), and support vector regression (SVR) chemometric approaches, Cubist model outperformed both SVR and PLSR. Most soil properties were estimated with high accuracy (concordance coefficient >= 0.7) using the Cubist model, except for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), available K and B. The high quality of the prediction models maybe owing to the variability in properties of the four different soils captured through conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. Results from this study also suggest that soil samples collected from multiple depths may be used for predicting both surface (0-30 cm) and sub-surface (30-90 cm) soil properties. Thus, this tool can help reduce the cost of laboratory analysis, even if it requires analysis of samples for calibration for the development of a successful spectral library across provinces.

Soil samples from four different depths (0-10, 10-30, 30-60 and 60-90 cm) of 32 profiles in each of these site were used to create a database of soil chemical and physical properties. Spectral reflectance values at 1 nm interval covering visible to shortwave-infrared (350-2,500 nm) were collected for each of these soil samples to develop partial least squares regression models. Soil textural fractions, soil organic carbon contents and available N were well predicted by the DRS approach with R-2 values larger than 0.75. Moderate to poor estimation efficiencies were observed for remaining parameters. Nevertheless, the estimated soil attributes and their corresponding measured soil parameters were used as inputs to an input recommendation model of soil diagnosis to create input recommendation for a targeted cocoa yield of 1,000 kg dry cocoa beans ha(-1) Resulting input recommendations were similar for both of these input sources (measured and DRS-estimated) suggesting that the DRS approach may provide an easy way to create input recommendations.

Biofunctool (R). uses a set of twelve indicators to monitor changes in three key soil functions: carbon transformation, nutrient cycling and structure maintenance (part A). Information from all the indicators is integrated in a Soil Quality Index using multivariate analysis (PCA) weighting. We used Biofunctool (R) to assess the impact of land use, land use change and agricultural practices on soil quality. The Biofunctool (R) index was measured for soils in Thailand within rubber plantations, forests and intensive cash crops (cassava and sugar cane). The results demonstrate that the Biofunctool (R) index provides an aggregated synthetic soil functioning score that is sensitive to land management and is robust in various pedo-climatic contexts. Firstly, the index revealed the impact on soil of land conversion from annual cropping to rubber plantations and ranked the effect on soil with respect to a natural forest reference. Secondly, it showed the positive effect of legume cover-crops on soil functioning. Thirdly, it highlighted a trend of improving soil quality with increasing age of rubber plantations, in contrasted pedo-climatic contexts. It is concluded that the Biofunctool (R) index is a reliable and relevant descriptor of integrated soil functioning (i.e. soil quality) that could be useful for environmental impact assessment at regional to global scales.

We developed the Biofunctool (R) framework to assess soil quality based on an integrative approach that accounts for the link between the physico-chemical properties and the biological activity of soils. Biofunctool (R) consists in a set of twelve in-field, time- and cost-effective indicators to assess three main soil functions: carbon transformation, nutrient cycling and structure maintenance. The indicators were applied in a network of mostly rubber plantations compared with three other land uses in Thailand. We collected 1952 indicators values in 180 sampling points over a wide range of pedo-climatic and agronomic contexts in order to assess the validity of the indicators. A reliability, redundancy and sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the capacity of the set of indicators to assess the impact of land management on soil quality. The results showed the relevance and consistence of each of the twelve indicators to assess the soil functioning. Improvements are finally discussed to guide further implementation of the indicators in various contexts and build a soil quality index.

However, assessments based on short-term SOC dynamics face methodological and experimental difficulties. Hurisso et al. (2016) proposed a method to assess SOC dynamics by coupling two methods: Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon (POXC) and Basal Soil Respiration (BSR). This method has been used in laboratory on dried and re-wetted soil samples from temperate regions mainly. In our study, we adapted this method to the field and proposed a cost-effective in-field indicator combining the POXC and in situ Basal Soil Respiration (SituResp (R) method). We tested the indicator at four study sites (n = 169 points) within various tropical land-use and management contexts based on rubber, soybean and oil palm cropping systems respectively in Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The results demonstrated the relevance, sensitivity and robustness of the POXC-SituResp (R) indicator to characterize the impact of a gradient of disturbance on SOC dynamics. The results also highlighted the potential of conservation agriculture (no-tillage and crops residues) and compost amendments to accumulate SOC. Rock-Eval (R) analysis showed that POXC-SituResp (R) indicator is negatively linked to excess of potentially mineralizable labile carbon. Carbon pools targeted by the POXC were specified by Rock-Eval (R) pyrolysis measurements to be a rather thermal resistant pool of SOC. Our study confirms that the integrated indicator based on POXC and BSR assess a relative carbon stabilization of SOC pools. This indicator can be measured in the field by a rapid and cost-effective method.

Their specific constraints lead to contrasted plot management, especially for fertilization and understory vegetation. Studies disentangling the agro-environmental impacts of oil palm smallholders' management practices at the plot scale remain scarce. The extent to which smallholders' practices affect both agronomic and environmental performances is still to be investigated with robust in-field studies to provide improvement tracks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the effects of both fertilization and understory vegetation management on soil health and oil palm performances. It explored a gradient of management practices, within homogeneous soil and climate conditions and historical development. The objective was to isolate and decipher the specific effects of some key practices on the overall plantation performances. METHODS: We surveyed 16 ex-plasma oil palm smallholders' 25-year old plots, gathering detailed information on management and implementing field measurements (48 points). For soil health assessment, we applied Biofunctool (R) that consists of nine in-site indicators informing on the soil ability to transform carbon, recycle nutrient and maintain its structure. For the oil palm performances, we relied on conventional appraisal parameters, such as yields, leaf area and nutrient leaf analyses. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted that fertilization, especially potassium, played a significant role in sustaining oil palm performances. Understory vegetation had a direct and positive effect on soil structure maintenance indicators. Soil structure improvement was correlated with enhanced oil palm performances. Those results highlighted that, besides nutritional aspects, increasing plot biodiversity through understory vegetation maintenance was associated with enhanced soil health hence potential greater ecosystem functions. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings have implications in terms of better understanding the effects of combined farming practices on the soil-oil palm continuum. It especially highlighted the key role of understory vegetation to improve soil structure maintenance without competing with oil palms in the studied context.

Thus depending on their light transmission, coloured nets used to protect plants from pests and limit irradiance can also impact plant growth and production. Tomato plants have been grown under blue or red nets transmitting similar photosynthetic yield from transplanting until the end of the fruit harvest to determine the importance of the light spectrum on plant growth, reproductive characteristics and fruit chemical composition. The morphological traits, organ physiology and fruit composition were strongly influenced by net colour. Plants under the red net were taller with a greater leaf area and a shoot to root ratio. An increased blue to red ratio slightly enhanced the reproductive development (visible bud development and 1st flowering) of tomato plants. An increased red to blue ratio enhanced the tomato glucose (17 %) and fructose (6 %) contents, while the citric (5 %) and malic acids (4 %) contents decreased, triggering a higher sugar/acid ratio. A high blue to red light limited organ growth and plant light interception was reduced despite a higher photosynthetic yield and a slight enhancement of the organ appearance rate. In addition, a low blue to red light increased fruit weight at harvest and even if it did not significantly improve fruit yield, it favoured fruit quality as it enhanced the tomato sugar/acid ratio.

The aim of this study was to quantify, in an integrated conceptual framework, the effect of N nutrition on potted grapevine growth and storage over 2 consecutive years. The consequences of using destructive measurements were investigated using a hierarchical Bayesian model. The rate and duration of leaf growth were both positively impacted by the chlorophyll content of the leaves, but they were negatively impacted by the initial carbohydrate measurements, raising a distortion in the estimation of initial reserves. The C production per unit of global radiation depended on the leaf area dynamics. The allocation of dry matter mainly relied on the phenological stage. The present study highlights the importance of using appropriate statistical methods to overcome uncertainties due to destructive measurements. The genericity of the statistical approach presented may encourage its implementation in other agronomy studies. Based on our results, a simple conceptual framework of grapevine pluriannual growth under various N supplies was built. This provides a relevant basis for a future model of C and N balance and responses to N fertilization in grapevine. The pluriannual dynamics of grapevine growth responses to nitrogen supply were quantified using a Bayesian approach to account for statistical errors associated with destructive measurements.

Rubber sector stakeholders consequently engaged in sustainable production of rubber. Despite the lack of harvest during the immature stage following planting, this period plays a key role in future yields. Management practices, particularly fertilization regimes, are used by farmers to shorten the immature period as much as possible. This entails maintaining or even improving the productivity of existing plantations to face the demand for natural rubber. This review focuses specifically on the immature period of rubber tree plantations, as it is the most critical period for nutrient management. We reviewed available knowledge on fertilization practices, soil management, and nutrient dynamics in rubber plantations with the goal of developing a nutrient balance approach for this crop. Our review revealed (1) a notable difference between fertilizer recommendations made by technical institutes and those reported in the scientific literature; (2) that even though nutrient diagnostic methods could help growers adapt the fertilization of rubber trees more than 3years of age, further studies are needed to adapt current methods to the wide range of cultivation areas; and (3) that the nutrient budget approach may be the best way to incorporate the variety of rubber tree cultivation conditions. In conclusion, the nutrient budget method is a promising way to improve the sustainability of rubber plantations through fertilization making it possible to increase nutrient use efficiency. A comprehensive approach based on nutrient budgets requires further in-depth studies to examine nutrient dynamics in a wide range of conditions, including intercropping and logging residue management between clearcutting and replanting."

Different tools can be used in order to detect differences in N status of the plant, including direct measurements of soil, plant nitrogen status (eg. petiole; must), or indirect observations of plant nutritional status such as leaf transmittance or reflectance (eg. SPAD; NDVI). However, the relationships between these indicators of nitrogen status and the overall plant functioning over vintages remain poorly known. The present study aimed at quantifying key vegetative and reproductive responses to plant nitrogen status over two successive seasons under different nitrogen supply levels. Methods and results: Potted plants of Sauvignon blanc grafted onto SO4 were grown outdoors in 2017 and 2018 with no water limitation. Four mineral nitrogen fertilization levels (equivalent to 0 kg of N ha(-1) or 0U, 20U, 40U, 80U) and one organic nitrogen fertilization level (40U) were imposed in 2017. These treatments were doubled in 2018 to increase the degree of nitrogen supply and consequently, the range of observed effects on plant growth and yield. Plant nitrogen status (SPAD) was monitored weekly during both growing cycles. Yield components were determined over the two seasons. Lastly, plant carbon status was addressed through dynamic measurement of plant development and photosynthesis, and destructive measurement of dry matter accumulation and carbon storage in annual and perennial organs at flowering, veraison and harvest. The SPAD values progressively decreased under lower N supply (0N) during the first year (from 31 to 16) and they were more than halved between the maximum and the minimum N treatments straight after budburst in year two (40 for 160N and 19 for 0N). Then, the differences in SPAD values among treatments were maintained up to harvest (2018). The gradient of N status resulted in a gradient of berry numbers per inflorescence (from 180 to 34 berries/inflorescence for 80N and 0N, respectively in 2018) and of individual berry dry matter at harvest (from 0.13 to 0.41 g for 160N and 0N, respectively in 2018). Quantitative relationships between N status and the relative reductions (% of reduction per % SPAD decrease) in terms of C gain (leaf area, photosynthesis), C growth (shoot, berry, trunk and root dry matter) and C storage (trunk and root) were fitted at flowering, veraison and harvest. The reduction in C gain under lower N supply was mainly related to the decrease in total leaf area before flowering (-1.64 %). Although the photosynthesis rate tended to decrease under N deficiency over the season, it only poorly contributed to the reduction in C gain. The whole plant C growth was inhibited when N status decreased (-1.13 % at harvest), due to the inhibition of shoot dry matter before veraison (-1.81 %) and to a lower extent, to the lower dry matter in berries (-0.80 %), trunks (-0.42 %) and roots (-0.84 %) at harvest. Part of the reduction in root dry matter was related to the lower starch reserves (-0.31 %) at harvest. Interestingly, starch reserves tended to be higher under organic N supply than mineral N supply. Conclusion: The present results provided a general framework of carbon gain and use over time (within and between seasons) as impacted by N supply levels and form. Such a framework will be useful when building a model of the pluri-annual dynamics of carbon balance related to yield elaboration in grapevines."

Our study compared eddy-covariance measurements of carbon and water fluxes from two rubber monoculture plantations (at a northern marginal site and a southern traditional plantation site) with a second-growth NF between 2015 and 2018, and their responses to a prolonged drought during 2015/2016. The NF had higher light use efficiency, water use efficiency and gross primary productivity (GPP, 2.94 +/- 0.41 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) than the northern rubber (NR) monoculture (2.45 +/- 0.17 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)), while lower ecosystem carbon use efficiency (eCUE) caused a lower net ecosystem productivity (NEP, 0.75 +/- 0.25 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to the plantation (1.19 +/- 0.22 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Drought decreased the NF eCUE by 23% with significant carbon uptake restrictions across multiple seasons, while the rubber GPP reduction was only substantial in the warm-dry season with an overall 17% decline in eCUE. The NR site's GPP was mainly controlled by soil water content throughout the year. Higher light availability offset the negative effect of drier conditions on the rubber GPP, resulting in larger carbon uptake compared to the southern plantation (GPP, 2.12 +/- 0.12 kg C m(-2) yr(-1); NEP, 1.07 +/- 0.14 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the NF GPP was mainly restricted by vapor pressure deficit, especially during the drought."

While protecting intact or semi-intact biodiverse forest is paramount, improving biodiversity value within the 11.4 million hectares of existing rubber plantations could offer important conservation benefits, if yields are also maintained. Some farmers practice agroforestry with high-yielding clonal rubber varieties to increase and diversify incomes. Here, we ask whether such rubber agroforestry improves biodiversity value or affects rubber yields relative to monoculture. We surveyed birds, fruit-feeding butterflies and reptiles in 25 monocultural and 39 agroforest smallholder rubber plots in Thailand, the world's biggest rubber producer. Management and vegetation structure data were collected from each plot, and landscape composition around plots was quantified. Rubber yield data were collected for a separate set of 34 monocultural and 47 agroforest rubber plots in the same region. Reported rubber yields did not differ between agroforests and monocultures, meaning adoption of agroforestry in this context should not increase land demand for natural rubber. Butterfly richness was greater in agroforests, where richness increased with greater natural forest extent in the landscape. Bird and reptile richness were similar between agroforests and monocultures, but bird richness increased with the height of herbaceous vegetation inside rubber plots. Species composition of butterflies differed between agroforests and monocultures, and in response to natural forest extent, while bird composition was influenced by herbaceous vegetation height within plots, the density of non-rubber trees within plots (representing agroforestry complexity) and natural forest extent in the landscape. Reptile composition was influenced by canopy cover and open habitat extent in the landscape. Conservation priority and forest-dependent birds were not supported within rubber. Synthesis and applications. Rubber agroforestry using clonal varieties provides modest biodiversity benefits relative to monocultures, without compromising yields. Agroforests may also generate ecosystem service and livelihood benefits. Management of monocultural rubber production to increase inter-row vegetation height and complexity may further benefit biodiversity. However, biodiversity losses from encroachment of rubber onto forests will not be offset by rubber agroforestry or rubber plot management. This evidence is important for developing guidelines around biodiversity-friendly rubber and sustainable supply chains, and for farmers interested in diversifying rubber production.

However, its limited adoption by farmers is often ascribed to initial yield penalties during the transition to CA and to trade-offs around crop biomass use. Here, we assess the effect of different CA-based cropping systems promoted in the region on water productivity and cotton yield in a three-year cotton/maize (Zea mays L.) crop rotation during the initial transition phase to CA. Three CA options were assessed combining different levels of soil disturbance and cover, and introducing cover crops to alleviate the biomass trade-offs. Direct seeding (DS), strip tillage (ST), and direct seeding mulched-based cropping systems (DMC) were compared with conventional tillage (CT) from 2017 to 2019 under a dominant soil type in the region, Haplic Lixisols. Two legume species, Stylosanthes guianensis (Aubl.) Sw. and Crotalaria retusa L. were grown as cover crops with maize under ST and DMC. The experiment followed a randomized block design comprising six replicates. After 2-3 years of DMC, the cotton yield advantage with respect to CT increased from 5 % to 7 %. Cotton yield penalties of respectively 11 % in 2018 and 26 % in 2019 were found for DS. ST treatment went from a yield advantage of 8 % in 2017 to a yield penalty of 20 % in 2019. The DMC and CT treatments gave similar and highest boll weights compared to the ST and DS treatments. The treatments had no significant difference regarding the number of bolls per plant. Soil water storage in the upper 30 cm depth and water use efficiency (WUE) were the highest in the plots with the DMC treatment compared to CT, ST, and DS. At 28 days of active vegetative stage (between 34 and 62 days after sowing), the WUE of seed cotton was 0.11 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) under DMC, while it was 0.08, 0.07, and 0.04 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) under DS, CT, and ST, respectively. The performance of DMC at increasing water productivity could be an argument to improve adoptability by farmers in northern Benin who are facing increased weather variability, given that the yield penalties often associated with early transitions to CA were not observed here with full DMC.

Therefore, we analysed how soil properties and maize yields in those systems are affected by two contrasting categories of land-management practices and fertilisation options. We used a synchronic approach to split these practices and options into two successive steps. In Step 1, referred to as cropped fields, tenants continuously intercrop maize among scattered oil palms. In Step 2, referred to as fallows, the land is densely planted with oil palm, without intercropping. Twelve farmers' fields were selected for this study. Eight represent cropping fields, and four are 15-year-old oil-palm fallows. Cropped field fertilisation treatments consisted of farmyard manure (at 15 and 30 t ha(-1)) and mineral fertiliser (150 kg ha(-1) of N14P18K18S6B1 + 50 kg ha(-1) of urea). We found no significant differences between the N contents and C:N ratios of the two types of fields. However, the numbers and masses of earthworm casts were higher in cropped fields treated with farmyard manure than with mineral fertiliser. Farmyard manure (15 and 30 t ha(-1) rates) also produced significantly higher maize yields (respectively, 2.5 and 3.2 t ha(-1)) than the mineral fertiliser alone (1.9 t of maize per ha). We conclude by discussing N, K and P storage in soil, and recommended use of farmyard manure as an agroforestry practice that will benefit landowners and tenants alike on the Adja plateau.
