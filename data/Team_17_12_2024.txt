Abstract: Simple Summary Greek kiwi production systems suffer from a Pollination Services (PS) shortage due to the declining number of wild pollinators. This study assesses the barriers towards the implementation of a PS market in Greek kiwi production systems by conducting two separate quantitative surveys, one for beekeepers and one for kiwi producers. The field survey findings corroborate the existence of a strong basis for further collaboration between the two stakeholders, as both of them acknowledge the importance of PS. Moreover, the farmers' willingness to pay and the beekeepers' willingness to receive regarding the renting of their hives for PS were examined. The kiwi is a highly insect-pollinated dependent crop and is the cornerstone of the Greek agricultural sector, rendering the country as the fourth biggest kiwi producer worldwide, with an expected increase in national production the following years. This extensive transformation of the Greek arable land to Kiwi monocultures in combination with a worldwide shortage of pollination services due to the wild pollinators' decline raises questions for the provision of pollination services, and consequently, for the sustainability of the sector. In many countries, this shortage of pollination services has been addressed by the installation of pollination services markets, such as those in the USA and France. Therefore, this study tries to identify the barriers towards the implementation of a pollination services market in Greek kiwi production systems by conducting two separate quantitative surveys, one for beekeepers and one for kiwi producers. The findings showed a strong basis for further collaboration between the two stakeholders, as both of them acknowledge the importance of pollination services. Moreover, the farmers' willingness to pay and the beekeepers' willingness to receive of the beekeepers regarding the renting of their hives for pollination services were examined.

Abstract: Heat and drought stresses have become more frequent and intense in the Mediterranean, strongly influ-encing arable crop phenology, growth, and grain yield. Agroforestry systems can effectively buffer the adverse climate conditions and stabilize or even increase crop yield under climate change. However, the positive effects of agroforestry remain uncertain due to the possible intense competition between trees and crops, especially for legume crops that have been less studied than cereals in such context. This study aimed to assess the response of the phenology, growth, grain yield, and yield-related traits of chickpea (Cicer arietinum), faba bean (Vicia faba), and lentil (Lens culinaris) to olive-based agroforestry (AFS) as compared to sole crops system (SCS) in the South of the Mediterranean. We conducted a field experiment during two growing seasons marked by an intense drought, either at the beginning (year 1) or at the end (year 2) of the crop cycle. Crop growth and yield were lower in year 1 than in year 2, reflecting the adverse growing conditions caused by the early drought. They were also lower in AFS than in SCS for both years, indicating that trees had competitive effects on crops. In year 1, the yield loss of grains in AFS was 66 % for lentil, 47 % for chickpea, and 43 % for faba bean compared to SCS, confirming the greater shade sensitivity of lentil. In year 2, the reduction was significantly smaller and was about 46 %, 34 %, 38 % for lentil, chickpea and, faba bean, respectively. The number of pods and grains were the most affected yield components by agroforestry and drought timing across the three legumes crops. Similar responses were found when comparing crops at different distances to trees within the AFS field. Crops generally had lower biomass and yield, explained by fewer pods and grains, on the northern side of trees compared to the southern side of trees or the middle of tree inter-rows, causing significant spatial heterogeneity in crops. However, lentil and chickpea had a positive response to shade during the early drought year while a negative response during the late drought year, suggesting that the benefits of the microclimate created by olive trees express depending on drought timing and crop physiology. Our study supports legume integration into AFS, suggesting that chickpea should be considered during high-stress conditions, while faba bean should be preferred during low-stress conditions.(c) 2023 The Authors.

Abstract: In Morocco, agroforestry systems based on olive trees are widespread and diverse. This work aims at characterizing their diversity and performance. To this end, 72 farmers surveys were conducted in the Moulay Driss Zerhoun region (Morocco). For each farm, agroforestry plots were compared to corresponding monocrops and pure olive orchards. Under rainfed conditions, the insertion of legumes and cereals in olive orchards is the dominant association. There are very significant differences in yields of annual crops and olive between agroforestry systems, and monocrops and pure orchards. The Land Equivalent Ratio of yields and gross margins is always greater than 1 with cereals and legumes in agroforestry. Our results suggest that agroforestry systems are more productive, profitable and land-efficient than monocrops. Therefore, agroforestry may constitute a relevant strategy for a sustainable production. Nevertheless, additional experiments are needed to better understand the productivity of these systems and their advantages and limits.

Abstract: Studies about nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification in deep soil layers are rare because N processes are considered to occur mainly in topsoil that hosts active and diverse microbial communities. This study aimed to measure the soil potential net N mineralization (PNM) and nitrification (PNN) down to 4 m depth and to discuss factors controlling their variability. Twenty-one soil cores were collected at the Restinclieres agroforestry experimental site, where 14-year-old hybrid walnut trees were intercropped with durum wheat. Soil cores were incubated in the dark in the laboratory at both 6 and 25 degrees C. The soil was a deep calcic fluvisol with a fluctuating water table. It featured a black layer that was very rich in organic matter and permanently water saturated at depths between 3.0 and 4.0 m. The mean soil mineral N content was 3 mg N kg(-1) soil in the upper 0.0-0.2 m layer, decreasing until a depth of 2 m and increasing to the maximum value of 25.8 mg N kg(-1) soil in the black layer. While nitrate (NO3-) was the dominant form of mineral N (89%) in the upper 0.0-0.2 m layer, its proportion progressively decreased with depth until ammonium (NH4+) became almost the only form of mineral N (97%) in the saturated black layer. Laboratory soil incubation revealed that PNM and PNN occurred at all depths, although the latter remained low at 6 degrees C. The soil nitrate content in the black layer was multiplied by 48 times after 51 days of incubation at 25 degrees C, whereas it was almost inexistent at the sampling date. While the soil total N, the pH and the incubation temperature explained 84% of the variation in PNM, only 29% of the percent nitrification variance was explained by the incubation temperature (T-inc) and the soil C-to-N ratio. These results point out the necessity to consider soil potential net N mineralization and nitrification of deep soil layers to improve model predictions.

Abstract: This study aimed at investigating the effects of regulated deficit irrigation one year on return-bloom and characteristics of inflorescences and fruit-set in the following year. In three consecutive years, 2012, 2013 and 2014, trees were subjected to two water regimes: Control (well-watered, WW), and 50% water deficit during one summer month, July (water-stressed, WS). In 2014, almost all 2013-shoots had a terminal inflorescence. They were separated into three length classes: short, 0.5-2 cm; medium, 2-11 cm; and long, equal or longer than 11 cm. Within each 2013-shoot size category, leaf number and leaf area of terminal inflorescences on these shoots were not affected significantly by the water regime. In the long shoot category, WW gave higher values for the bourse-shoot number in comparison to WS. The number of flowers per terminal inflorescence did not vary between WS and WW. To conclude, our results showed that the number of nodes of a shoot in 2013, and the number of leaves, leaf area and fruit-set of the inflorescence in 2014 as well as the frequency of bourse-overbourse between the couples of years 2012-13 and 2013-14 were not affected by moderate water stress. Overall, a 50% water stress over one month in summer for a late season cultivar did not decrease shoot growth in the same year, likely because shoot growth was already finished by summer months. Interestingly, it also did not affect inflorescence development, fruit-set and bourse-shoot formation in the following year. Working on a late cultivar, i.e. 'JoyaT', with a long period of fruit growth, likely buffers the effects of summer water deficit. Our study supported the idea that regulated deficit irrigation needs to be adapted to the conditions and the cultivar.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different crop load levels on apple trees' yield and physiological characteristics, emphasizing the relationship between stem water potential and crop load and the link between trunk diameter growth and crop load. It was conducted in 2014 at Station Experimentale Fruits et Legumes (SUDEXPE-CEHM) in Southern France. The 'Joya (TM)' apple on Pajam-1 rootstock was used as the plant material. Trees were subjected to hand thinning to obtain four final crop load levels as high (100%; 10 fruit/cm(2) of branch cross-sectional area (BCSA)), medium-high (75%; 7.5 fruit/cm(2) of BCSA), medium-low (50%; 5 fruit/cm(2) of BCSA) and low (25%; 2.5 fruit/cm(2) of BCSA). The four crop load levels were set up in a randomized block design with four replications, and each plot was formed of five uniform trees. Stem water potential was weakly affected by crop load but was mainly driven by vapor pressure deficit. The maximum daily trunk diameter, by and large, reduced while crop load level increased. The increase in crop load level was negatively related to fruit size, acidity and soluble solids content. Crop load did not affect bitter pit incidence. However, in parallel to the increasing crop load level, cumulative yield, yield efficiency and water productivity increased.

Abstract: This study was conducted at the Station Experimentale Fruits et Legumes in the South-East Mediterranean region of France and aimed to explore the effects of water-deficit stress on fruit production, water status, and growth responses. It was carried out on a 9-year-old top worked apple cv. "Joya (TM)" on Pajam-1 rootstock. Water stress (at 50%) applied after vegetative growth was completed, from the beginning of July to the end of the irrigation season decreased size but increased soluble solids content in fruit. Water-stressed trees showed relatively high water use efficiency without causing a significant effect on yield. Indeed, the water amount used for one fruit was 11.41 (median) in water-stressed trees and 15.91 (median) in well-watered trees, although tree volume and leaf area were similar between the two water regimes. A within-tree network of dendrometers was installed in four locations (bottom of a branch and end of the same branch, fruit, and trunk). The branch and trunk's maximum and minimum diameter growth were observed in the morning and noon, respectively, over the diurnal period, whatever the water regime. The maximal diameter growth of fruit in both water regimes was during the afternoon on a diurnal basis, unlike vegetative tree portions.

Abstract: Fruit production should be adapted to future scenarios that are frequently associated with scarce resources, especially freshwater and fertilizers. New biologically-based fruit production strategies, i.e. taking into account tree growth and water status, are required to optimize irrigation and fertilization under abiotic stress conditions. It was hypothesized that a moderate abiotic stress, here deficit irrigation with or without nitrogen deficit, in the preharvest period, could decrease postharvest losses due to diseases and pruning weights due to reduced vegetative growth, without sacrificing the yield and fruit quality. This study was conducted over two years using the same trees of 'Moncante' nectarine cultivar grown in a commercial orchard. Trees were assigned to three treatments: (1) full irrigation at 80% estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc), (2) deficit irrigation, i.e. at 75% of full irrigation, and (3) deficit irrigation and deficit nitrogen, i.e. at 75% of full irrigation and 75% of usual N-fertilization adopted by the grower in this commercial orchard. Deficit irrigation alone and in combination with deficit nitrogen reduced postharvest diseases and pruning weights without significant yield losses. Our results suggest that ETc-based approaches of reduced water irrigation may be a sustainable way to decrease phytosanitary inputs and workload in the orchard while maintaining the orchard performance.

Abstract: Agroforestry could be a major strategy to adapt agriculture to climate change, thanks to the microclimate effects of trees and improved infiltration. However, the experimental validation of these claims is scarce. In this methodological review, we discuss options for the experimental simulation of drought conditions in agroforestry field experiments, comparing it with strategies adopted in natural, agricultural, or forestry ecosystems. We classify rainout shelters used in field experiments according to mobility, completeness of rain interception and height of rainout shelter. We show that specificities of agroforestry systems create constraints and require compromises in the design and operation of rainout shelters. We conclude that large rainout shelters, which induce drought for both the trees and the crops while limiting artifacts and biases, would be most relevant for studying the resistance of agroforestry systems to drought. Unfortunately, the review of rainout shelters already used in agroforestry systems reveals a lack of rainout shelters capable of intercepting rain on both trees and crops, achieving total rain interception, while being relatively low-cost and manageable by a small team. Therefore, we benchmark three novel rainout shelter designs that we tested in a mature agroforestry system under Mediterranean climatic conditions. We discuss their advantages and disadvantages in terms of both scientific and operational aspects. While compromises had to be done between experimental design, risks of artifact/bias, effectiveness, ease of installation, operation and maintenance, and agricultural management, these prototypes are starting points for achieving well-performing rainout shelters and testing the effects of drought in agroforestry experiments.

Abstract: In West Africa, farmers face challenges to innovate and change their practices toward more sustainable cropping systems. Farmer Field Schools (FFS), an advisory service based on participatory principles, aim to support farmers' innovation. This study investigates farmers' innovation by characterizing their trajectories of change in agricultural practices after they participated in FFS. Two contrasting types of FFS for family farmers in the cotton-growing area of West Africa were selected. The FFS differed in how they were implemented; farmer participation was either consultative (farmers participated little in developing the FFS curricula and structure) or collaborative (farmers participated actively in developing the FFS curricula and structure). Former FFS participants were interviewed on their successive changes in cropping practices over a 4 to 8-year time span. The sample included seven FFS on rainy season cropping (17 interviews in Burkina Faso, 22 in Togo), and four vegetable gardening FFS (21 interviews in Togo). The Efficiency-Substitution-Redesign framework was applied to pest management, organic and mineral fertilization and legume cropping practices. Our results show that the way FFS were implemented influenced farmers' trajectories of change in practices. After consultative FFS, changes in practices were limited. After collaborative FFS, we found a variety of changes in the production and use of compost, biopesticides, and inclusion of legumes in the cropping system through intercropping or pure cropping. Redesign of cropping systems included increasing on-farm compost production, collective pest management, and crop rotations. Collaborative FFS can be seen as step-by-step design processes for locally adapted cropping systems. This is the first time that farmers' trajectories of change in practices are used to assess the effects of FFS. This approach is valuable for understanding farmers' decision making and the role of participatory innovation support initiatives such as FFS.

Abstract: Following the Paris agreement in 2015, the European Union (EU) set a carbon neutrality objective by 2050, and so did France. The French agricultural sector can contribute as a carbon sink through carbon storage in biomass and soil, in addition to reducing GHG emissions. The objective of this study is to quantitatively assess the additional storage potential and cost of a set of eight carbon-storing practices. The impacts of these agricultural practices on soil organic carbon storage and crop production are assessed at a very fine spatial scale, using crop and grassland models. The associated area base, GHG budget, and implementation costs are assessed and aggregated at the region level. The economic model BANCO uses this information to derive the marginal abatement cost curve for France and identify the combination of carbon storing practices that minimizes the total cost of achieving a given national net GHG mitigation target. We find that a substantial amount of carbon, 36.2 to 52.9 MtCO(2)e yr(-1), can be stored in soil and biomass for reasonable carbon prices of 55 and 250 (sic) tCO(2)e(-1), respectively (corresponding to current and 2030 French carbon value for climate action), mainly by developing agroforestry and hedges, generalising cover crops, and introducing or extending temporary grasslands in crop sequences. This finding questions the 3-5 times lower target of 10 MtCO(2)e.yr(-1) retained for the agricultural carbon sink by the French climate neutrality strategy. Overall, this would decrease total French GHG emissions by 9.2-13.8%, respectively (reference year 2019).

Abstract: The conventional cultivation of olive trees can lead to environmental degradations such as soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Agroforestry systems could bring solutions to these environmental degradations. A simulation model able to represent the growth and interactions between olive trees and annual crops would be useful to rapidly test and evaluate innovative olive-based agroforestry systems without the need for space and time-consuming field experiments. The Hi-sAFe model simulates agroforestry systems in three dimensions according to interactions between forest trees and annual crops for water, nitrogen and light. However, this model was developed and parameterised only for forest trees and not for fruit trees whose balance between the vegetative and the fruit organs is crucial. Two main adaptations were made to the model to simulate olive-based agroforestry systems: the addition of a fruit-setting module and the carbon allocation module adaptation. Here, we present the experimental estimation of two important parameters of these modules, both at tree scale: the maximum number of fruits m-2 leaf area and the maximum daily carbon allocation to fruits. The maximum fruit load per olive trees was estimated at 1356 fruits per m(2) leaf area using three genotypes of an ' Arbequina' x 'Oliviere' progeny. To determine the maximum daily carbon allocation to fruits, we hypothesized a cultivar effect. For these reason, nine olive trees, of three cultivars ('Leccino', 'Cypressino' and 'Manzanille'), with a low fruit load were selected from the three cultivars, and samples of fruits were dry-weighted every week for 12 weeks during fruit growth. The maximum daily carbon allocation to fruits (g carbon olive(-1) day(-1)) varied significantly between 'Leccino' and 'Cypressino' (3.9x10(-3) and 4.3x10(-3), respectively) and 'Manzanille' (7.3x10(-3)). The value of these two parameters not identifiable in the literature can be set to 1356 fruits m(-2) of leaf area (maximum number of fruits m-2 leaf area) and at 7.3x10(-3) g carbon olive(-1) day(-1) (maximum daily carbon allocation to fruits).

Abstract: Agroforestry, the integration of trees, crops, and animals, is expected to increase environmental sustainability of fruit production compared to traditional orchards. Virtual experiments with models would allow the performance and sustainability of these systems to be evaluated in a range of pedoclimatic and management scenarios, taking into account the interactions of fruit trees with crops. The models should represent tree and crop growth in 3D, run simulations over the whole life cycle of the orchard, and account for management practices that influence tree-crop interactions. We reviewed existing fruit tree and agroforestry models and have proposed a decision tree to guide future modellers in choosing a model that meets their simulation objectives. None of the reviewed models met all requirements, but we identified improvements that could be made to two existing models to accurately simulate temperate fruit tree based agroforestry systems.

Abstract: Plant dehydration tolerance confers drought survival in grasses, but the mortality thresholds according to soil water content (SWC), vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and plant-plant interactions are little explored. We compared the dehydration dynamics of leaf meristems, which are the key surviving organs, plant mortality, and recovery of Mediterranean and temperate populations of two perennial grass species, Dactylis glomerata and Festuca arundinacea, grown in monocultures and mixtures under a low-VPD (1.5 kPa) versus a high-VPD drought (2.2 kPa). The lethal drought index (LD50), that is, SWC associated with 50% plant mortality, ranged from 2.87% (psi s = -1.68 MPa) to 2.19% (psi s = -4.47 MPa) and reached the lowest values under the low-VPD drought. Populations of D. glomerata were more dehydration-tolerant (lower LD50), survived and recovered better than F. arundinacea populations. Plant-plant interactions modified dehydration tolerance and improved post-drought recovery in mixtures compared with monocultures. Water content as low as 20.7%-36.1% in leaf meristems allowed 50% of plants to survive. We conclude that meristem dehydration causes plant mortality and that drought acclimation can increase dehydration tolerance. Genetic diversity, acclimation and plant-plant interactions are essential sources of dehydration tolerance variability to consider when predicting drought-induced mortality.

Abstract: Raising Climate Change (CC) awareness is crucial for mitigating the negative effects of this phenomenon, as well as for ensuring a sustainable future for upcoming generations. This study assesses and compares the climate change awareness level of Mediterranean university students in France and Greece. Emphasis was given to three research questions regarding knowledge, information sources, and awareness level. A questionnaire was used to determine the knowledge level and awareness of 641 university students in France and Greece. Principal Component Analysis was used to determine the main factors influencing the above-mentioned aspects, as was an independent sample t-test to compare the sample's awareness level and socio-economic characteristics. Based on a modified climate change awareness index developed by the researchers, most students were found to have a low level of awareness of climate change. However, there is evidence that students are willing to undertake specific eco-friendly initiatives. Additionally, one of the study's key findings is that students' knowledge and awareness of climate change varies according to socio-demographic characteristics such as gender, age, income level, and academic field. Nationality was proved to be a significant factor influencing belief in CC and willingness to take action. Incentives for both formal and informal information should be provided by policymakers to ensure theoretical background as well as climate change-related actions, in order to raise climate change awareness across younger generations.

Abstract: In this study, we present an operational methodology for mapping irrigated areas at plot scale, which overcomes the limitation of terrain data availability, using Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical time series. The method was performed over a study site located near Orleans city of north-central France for four years (2017 until 2020). First, training data of irrigated and non-irrigated plots were selected using predefined selection criteria to obtain sufficient samples of irrigated and non-irrigated plots each year. The training data selection criteria is based on two irrigation metrics; the first one is a SAR-based metric derived from the S1 time series and the second is an optical-based metric derived from the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) time series of the S2 data. Using the newly developed irrigation event detection model (IEDM) applied for all S1 time series in VV (Vertical-Vertical) and VH (Vertical-Horizontal) polarizations, an irrigation weight metric was calculated for each plot. Using the NDVI time series, the maximum NDVI value achieved in the crop cycle was considered as a second selection metric. By fixing threshold values for both metrics, a dataset of irrigated and non-irrigated samples was constructed each year. Later, a random forest classifier (RF) was built for each year in order to map the summer agricultural plots into irrigated/non-irrigated. The irrigation classification model uses the S1 and NDVI time series calculated over the selected training plots. Finally, the proposed irrigation classifier was validated using real in situ data collected each year. The results show that, using the proposed classification procedure, the overall accuracy for the irrigation classification reaches 84.3%, 93.0%, 81.8%, and 72.8% for the years 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The comparison between our proposed classification approach and the RF classifier built directly from in situ data showed that our approach reaches an accuracy nearly similar to that obtained using in situ RF classifiers with a difference in overall accuracy not exceeding 6.2%. The analysis of the obtained classification accuracies of the proposed method with precipitation data revealed that years with higher rainfall amounts during the summer crop-growing season (irrigation period) had lower overall accuracy (72.8% for 2017) whereas years encountering a drier summer had very good accuracy (93.0% for 2019).

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison between the Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2-derived soil moisture product at plot scale ((SMP)-M-2) and the new Copernicus surface soil moisture (C-SSM) product at 1-km scale over a wide region in southern France. In this study, both products were first evaluated using in situ measurements obtained by the calibrated time delay reflectometer in field campaigns. The accuracy against the in situ measurements was defined by the correlation coefficient R, the root mean square difference (RMSD), and the bias and the unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD). Then, the soil moisture estimations from both SSM products were intercompared over one year (October 2016-October 2017). Both products show generally good agreement with in situ measurements. The results show that using in situ measurements collected over agricultural areas and grasslands, the accuracy of the C-SSM is good (RMSD = 6.0 vol%, ubRMSD = 6.0 vol%, and R = 0.48) but less accurate than the (SMP)-M-2 (RMSD = 4.0 vol%, ubRMSD = 3.9 vol%, and R = 0.77). The intercomparison between the two SSM products over one year shows that both products are highly correlated over agricultural areas that are mainly used for cereals (R value between 0.5 and 0.9 and RMSE between 4 and 6 vol%). Over areas containing forests and vineyards, the C-SSM values tend to overestimate the (SMP)-M-2 values (bias > 5 vol%). In the case of well-developed vegetation cover, the (SMP)-M-2 does not provide SSM estimations while C-SSM sometimes provides underestimated SSM values.

Abstract: This study proposes an effective method to map rice crops using the Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) time series over the Camargue region, Southern France. First, the temporal behavior of the SAR backscattering coefficient over 832 plots containing different crop types was analyzed. Through this analysis, the rice cultivation was identified using metrics derived from the Gaussian profile of the VV/VH time series (3 metrics), the variance of the VV/VH time series (one metric), and the slope of the linear regression of the VH time series (one metric). Using the derived metrics, rice plots were mapped through two different approaches: decision tree and Random Forest (RF). To validate the accuracy of each approach, the classified rice map was compared to the available national data. Similar high overall accuracy was obtained using both approaches. The overall accuracy obtained using a simple decision tree reached 96.3%, whereas an overall accuracy of 96.6% was obtained using the RF classifier. The approach, therefore, provides a simple yet precise and powerful tool to map paddy rice areas.

Abstract: Better management of water consumption and irrigation schedule in irrigated agriculture is essential in order to save water resources, especially at regional scales and under changing climatic conditions. In the context of water management, the aim of this study is to monitor irrigation activities by detecting the irrigation episodes at plot scale using the Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) time series over intensively irrigated grassland plots located in the Crau plain of southeast France. The method consisted of assessing the newly developed irrigation detection model (IDM) at plot scale over the irrigated grassland plots. First, four S1-SAR time series acquired from four different S1-SAR acquisitions (different S1 orbits), each at six-day revisit time, were obtained over the study site. Next, the IDM was applied at each available SAR image from each S1-SAR series to obtain an irrigation indicator at each SAR image (no, low, medium, or high irrigation possibility). Then, the irrigation indicators obtained at each image from each S1-SAR time series (four series) were added and combined by threshold value criteria to determine the existence or absence of an irrigation event. Finally, the performance of the IDM for irrigation detection was assessed by comparing the in situ recorded irrigation events at each plot and the detected irrigation events. The results show that using only the VV polarization, 82.4% of the in situ registered irrigation events are correctly detected with an F_score value reaching 73.8%. Less accuracy is obtained using only the VH polarization, where 79.9% of the in situ irrigation events are correctly detected with an F_score of 72.2%. The combined use of the VV and VH polarization showed that 74.1% of the irrigation events are detected with a higher F_score value of 76.4%. The analysis of the undetected irrigation events revealed that, in the presence of very well-developed vegetation cover (normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) >= 0.8); higher uncertainty in irrigation detection is observed, where 80% of the undetected events correspond to an NDVI value greater than 0.8. The results also showed that small-sized plots encounter more false irrigation detections than large-sized plots certainly because the pixel spacing of S1 data (10 m x 10 m) is not adapted to small size plots. The obtained results prove the efficiency of the S1 C-band data and the IDM for detecting irrigation events at the plot scale, which would help in improving the irrigation water management at large scales especially with availability and global coverage of the S1 product.

Abstract: In the context of monitoring and assessment of water consumption in the agricultural sector, the objective of this study is to build an operational approach capable of detecting irrigation events at plot scale in a near real-time scenario using Sentinel-1 (S1) data. The proposed approach is a decision tree-based method relying on the change detection in the S1 backscattering coefficients at plot scale. First, the behavior of the S1 backscattering coefficients following irrigation events has been analyzed at plot scale over three study sites located in Montpellier (southeast France), Tarbes (southwest France), and Catalonia (northeast Spain). To eliminate the uncertainty between rainfall and irrigation, the S1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal and the soil moisture estimations at grid scale (10 km x 10 km) have been used. Then, a tree-like approach has been constructed to detect irrigation events at each S1 date considering additional filters to reduce ambiguities due to vegetation development linked to the growth cycle of different crops types as well as the soil surface roughness. To enhance the detection of irrigation events, a filter using the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Sentinel-2 optical images has been proposed. Over the three study sites, the proposed method was applied on all possible S1 acquisitions in ascending and descending modes. The results show that 84.8% of the irrigation events occurring over agricultural plots in Montpellier have been correctly detected using the proposed method. Over the Catalonian site, the use of the ascending and descending SAR acquisition modes shows that 90.2% of the non-irrigated plots encountered no detected irrigation events whereas 72.4% of the irrigated plots had one and more detected irrigation events. Results over Catalonia also show that the proposed method allows the discrimination between irrigated and non-irrigated plots with an overall accuracy of 85.9%. In Tarbes, the analysis shows that irrigation events could still be detected even in the presence of abundant rainfall events during the summer season where two and more irrigation events have been detected for 90% of the irrigated plots. The novelty of the proposed method resides in building an effective unsupervised tool for near real-time detection of irrigation events at plot scale independent of the studied geographical context.

Abstract: Mapping irrigated plots is essential for better water resource management. Today, the free and open access Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data with high revisit time offers a powerful tool for irrigation mapping at plot scale. Up to date, few studies have used S1 and S2 data to provide approaches for mapping irrigated plots. This study proposes a method to map irrigated plots using S1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) time series. First, a dense temporal series of S1 backscattering coefficients were obtained at plot scale in VV (Vertical-Vertical) and VH (Vertical-Horizontal) polarizations over a study site located in Catalonia, Spain. In order to remove the ambiguity between rainfall and irrigation events, the S1 signal obtained at plot scale was used conjointly to S1 signal obtained at a grid scale (10 km x 10 km). Later, two mathematical transformations, including the principal component analysis (PCA) and the wavelet transformation (WT), were applied to the several SAR temporal series obtained in both VV and VH polarization. Irrigated areas were then classified using the principal component (PC) dimensions and the WT coefficients in two different random forest (RF) classifiers. Another classification approach using one dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was also performed on the obtained S1 temporal series. The results derived from the RF classifiers with S1 data show high overall accuracy using the PC values (90.7%) and the WT coefficients (89.1%). By applying the CNN approach on SAR data, a significant overall accuracy of 94.1% was obtained. The potential of optical images to map irrigated areas by the mean of a normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) temporal series was also tested in this study in both the RF and the CNN approaches. The overall accuracy obtained using the NDVI in RF classifier reached 89.5% while that in the CNN reached 91.6%. The combined use of optical and radar data slightly enhanced the classification in the RF classifier but did not significantly change the accuracy obtained in the CNN approach using S1 data.

Abstract: One of the challenges of eco-efficient agriculture is the development of operational farming practices to increase the level of agricultural production, maximize the efficiency of resource use and reduce environmental impacts. Based on the efficiency frontier concept and the decomposition of resource use efficiency, we used a three-quadrant framework allowing to carry a functional analysis of the cropping system. Using a data envelope approach, we established boundary curves which represent the maximum achievable performances (yield, N uptake) when N is the only limiting factor. This framework has been first implemented and tested using published data from 112 agronomic situations of rainfed durum wheat in experimental fields in northern Syria and then further applied on a data set of 245 agronomic situations of durum wheat in farmers' fields in two grain-producing regions of Tunisia. The results demonstrated the impact of preceding crops: durum wheat following legumes or vegetable showed a higher potential for N uptake but with only a minor effect on its conversion into grains. This positive effect of diversified rotation on potential N uptake by durum wheat is partly of-set by increased N uptake gaps in farmer's fields indicating a higher effect of other limiting factors.

Abstract: Agroforestry (AF) is a promising land-use system to mitigate water deficiency, particularly in semi-arid areas. However, the belowground microbes associated with crops below trees remain seldom addressed. This study aimed at elucidating the effects of olive AF system intercropped with durum wheat (Dw), barely (Ba), chickpea (Cp), or faba bean (Fb) on crops biomass and their soil-rhizosphere microbial networks as compared to conventional full sun cropping (SC) under rainfed conditions. To test the hypothesis, we compared the prokaryotic and the fungal communities inhabiting the rhizosphere of two cereals and legumes grown either in AF or SC. We determined the most suitable annual crop species in AF under low-rainfed conditions. Moreover, to deepen our understanding of the rhizosphere network dynamics of annual crops under AF and SC systems, we characterized the microbial hubs that are most likely responsible for modifying the microbial community structure and the variability of crop biomass of each species. Herein, we found that cereals produced significantly more above-ground biomass than legumes following in descending order: Ba > Dw > Cp > Fb, suggesting that crop species play a significant role in improving soil water use and that cereals are well-suited to rainfed conditions within both types of agrosystems. The type of agrosystem shapes crop microbiomes with the only marginal influence of host selection. However, more relevant was to unveil those crops recruits specific bacterial and fungal taxa from the olive-belowground communities. Of the selected soil physicochemical properties, organic matter was the principal driver in shaping the soil microbial structure in the AF system. The co-occurrence network analyses indicated that the AF system generates higher ecological stability than the SC system under stressful climate conditions. Furthermore, legumes' rhizosphere microbiome possessed a higher resilient capacity than cereals. We also identified different fungal keystones involved in litter decomposition and drought tolerance within AF systems facing the water-scarce condition and promoting crop production within the SC system. Overall, we showed that AF reduces cereal and legume rhizosphere microbial diversity, enhances network complexity, and leads to more stable beneficial microbial communities, especially in severe drought, thus providing more accurate predictions to preserve soil diversity under unfavorable environmental conditions.

Abstract: In the face of climate change, more frequent drought events are expected in the Mediterranean regions. Alley cropping is an agroforestry practice that represents a promising adaptation strategy to sustain yield productivity under drier conditions. However, the presence of trees limits the productivity of the intercrop by reducing light availability and by competing for soil water resources, which could potentially exacerbate the yield losses due to drought conditions. Furthermore, the effects of co-occurring drought and shade stresses on annual crops are still poorly understood. To tackle this issue, we performed a rainfall manipulation experiment on winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown in full-sun conditions (agricultural control) and under different levels of shade in a 25-year walnut-based alley cropping system located in southern France. We evaluated first the effect of trees on light and water availability, and we then studied the effects of early drought (135 mm excluded from April to the end of May) and light conditions on crop performances and yield components. At 3.5 m from the tree line, light availability was reduced on average by 19% at south and 35% at north of trees over the entire crop cycle and mostly after tree budburst. The impact of trees on soil water content in the crop root zone was weak thanks to the good complementarity of the respective root systems. Under normal rainfall conditions, tree shade decreased pea yield from -25% to -77% compared to full-sun conditions. In case of spring drought, pea yield was decreased by -22% in full-sun conditions. The negative effect of tree shade was reduced and decreased pea yield only by -1% to -47%. Under the most intense shade conditions, pea yield was even higher under drought than in normal rainfall conditions. The analysis of crop dynamics and yield components revealed that the vegetative development of pea ceased under drought to the benefit of biomass allocation towards the reproductive organs. Pea yield was less impacted by tree shade under spring drought because yield elaboration relied less on the success of pod set, sensitive to shade and, more on grain filling, improved in case of early drought event. This study supports the hypothesis that agroforestry systems may be more resilient in the case of early drought.

Abstract: Through a meta-analysis, Mupepele et al. (BMC Ecol Evol 21:1-193, 2021) assessed the effects of European agroforestry systems on biodiversity, estimated by species richness or species diversity. They showed that the effects of silvoarable and silvopastoral systems depend on the systems they are compared to and the taxa studied. Further, they found that only silvoarable systems increased species richness or diversity, compared to cropland. The authors conclude that agroforestry systems have weak effects on biodiversity and that landscape context or land-use history are probably more important than the practice of agroforestry in itself. However, we draw attention to important shortcomings in this meta-analysis, which downplay the potential of agroforestry for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. We hope that the meta-analysis by Mupepele et al. (BMC Ecol Evol 21:1-193, 2021), and our comments, will contribute to improving the quality of research on agroforestry systems and biodiversity conservation.

Abstract: Alley cropping agroforestry is a land use practice in which arable crops are grown between tree rows. In such agroforestry systems, non-crop herbaceous vegetation develops on the tree rows, resulting in understory vegetation strips (UVS). UVS are perceived both as reservoirs for weeds and opportunities for biodiversity conservation. The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of UVS to (i) plant spillover and (ii) plant diversity conservation, depending on their functional structure and the farming system. Vegetation surveys were carried out in May 2017 in South-Western France over 16 winter cereal fields (8 alley cropping agroforestry systems and 8 pure crop controls), half under conventional farming and half under organic farming. Using data on plant functional traits related to dispersal strategies and response to agricultural disturbances, we explained the mechanisms involved in plant spillover between habitats. The study revealed that very few species were able to disperse far into crop alleys, except perennial species producing rhizomes and stolons whose spread has been favored by tillage. The presence of UVS in agroforestry fields did not increase weed-crop ratio (i.e. weed coverage / weed and crop coverage) in adjacent crop alleys. On the other hand, UVS harbored richer and more abundant floras (with high proportions of species rarely found in arable habitats) compared to crop alleys and pure crop controls, especially under conventional farming. The functional approach provided insights for weed management in alley cropping agroforestry systems in order to optimize plant diversity conservation without increasing weed-crop ratio. This study showed the relevance of using the functional approach to understand the mechanisms behind plant spillover in cropping systems that integrate semi-natural habitats.

Abstract: Developing agroecological practices that enhance biological control of crop pests is a major issue for the transition of agriculture towards sustainable and biodiversity-friendly systems. Agroecological infrastructures (AEI) are devoted to the support of ecosystem service providers, although they have mixed effects on natural enemies of crop pests. In temperate regions, alley cropping agroforestry involves within-field AEI, in the form of tree rows and associated understory vegetation strips. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of generalist predators (carabid beetles and cursorial spiders) to control weed seeds and invertebrate pests in alley cropping vs pure crop systems, under two contrasting farming systems (conventional vs organic). Predator surveys were carried out in May and June 2017 in South-Western France over 12 winter cereal fields. Our study revealed that the effect of alley cropping was modulated by the farming system. Under conventional farming, alley cropping had a negative effect on the activity-density and species richness of generalist predators, especially regarding carnivorous carabids whose activity-density was reduced by nearly 50%. Under organic farming, alley cropping enhanced both the activity-density and complementarity of generalist predators, with a two-fold increase in the activity-density of seed-feeding carabids (predominantly granivorous and omnivorous), potentially promoting weed seed and invertebrate pest control. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of AEI in promoting natural enemies depends on the farming system at the field scale, which affects resource availability and determines spillover intensity between habitats. AEI are often perceived as sources of natural enemies. However, sink and retention effects (i.e. reduced or delayed spillover into crop fields due to higher attractiveness of AEI) should not be overlooked as they can explain the mixed impacts of AEI on natural enemy communities.

Abstract: The dramatic decline of invertebrates at a global scale is mainly driven by habitat loss, agricultural intensification and urbanization. Alley cropping agroforestry is a land use practice in which arable crops are grown between tree rows. In such systems, understory vegetation strips (UVS) develop in the tree rows, providing habitats undisturbed by soil tillage. We investigated whether UVS are major overwintering habitats for invertebrates. We focused on carabid communities, which are dominant beneficial invertebrates in crop fields, but suffer from agricultural intensification. We described carabid communities with functional traits related to sensitivity to agricultural disturbances and ecological functions (i.e. pest control). Sampling of invertebrates were carried out from February to June 2018 over seven agroforestry fields in Restinclieres Estate (South France), one of the oldest experimental sites in Europe. The study revealed that 55% of invertebrate taxonomic groups were more abundant in UVS, whereas only 14% were more abundant in crop alleys. Crop pests were overwintering mainly in crop alleys while beneficial invertebrates were more dependent on UVS. Finally, UVS hosted carabids sensitive to agricultural disturbances, characterized by large body length, predominantly granivorous diet and overwintering in adult stage. On the other hand, crop alleys were home to smaller carnivorous species overwintering in both larval and adult stages, which can tolerate high levels of disturbance. Environmental and agricultural policies should consider agroforestry systems, especially understory vegetation strips, as valuable habitats for biodiversity conservation and biological control in agricultural landscapes.

Abstract: Background and Aims Decomposition is a major ecosystem process which improves soil quality. Despite that, only a few studies have analysed decomposition in an agricultural context, while most agrosystems (e.g. vineyards) are facing decreasing soil quality. The objective of this study is to understand the impacts of both pedoclimate and weed management on the mass loss of vineyard weed communities during the early stages of the decomposition process through their functional properties. Methods In 16 Mediterranean vineyards representing both a pedoclimate and a soil management gradient, we measured the mass loss of green above-ground biomass of 50 weed communities during decomposition in standard conditions and key leaf traits of dominant species [e.g. leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf lignin to nitrogen ratio (lignin:N)]. Both the mean [i.e. community-weighted mean (CWM)] and diversity (i.e. Rao index) were computed at the community level. Path analysis was used to quantify the effects of agro-environmental filters on the mass loss of weed communities through their functional properties. Key Results Tillage and mowing filtered more decomposable communities than chemical weeding (16 and 8 % of higher mass loss after 2 months of decomposition). Path analysis selected weed management practice type as the main factor determining mass loss through its effect on functional properties, while soil and climate had minor and no effects, respectively. Chemical weeding favoured communities with higher investment in resistant leaves (e.g. 38 % higher lignin:N, 22 % lower leaf nitrogen content) which resulted in lower mass loss compared with tilled and mowed communities. Mowing favoured communities with 47 % higher biomass and with 46 % higher nitrogen content. Conclusions Weed management significantly influenced weed mass loss, while the pedoclimate had little effect. Our results suggest that mowing is a promising alternative to herbicide use, favouring higher biomass, nitrogen content and decomposability potential of weeds.

Abstract: Winegrowers have diversified their weed management practices over the last two decades changing the structure and the composition of weed communities. Complementary to taxonomic studies, trait-based approaches are promising ways for a better understanding of weed community responses to environmental and agronomic filters. In the present study, the impacts of climate, soil characteristics, seasons and weed management practices (chemical weeding, tillage and mowing) were assessed on weed communities from 46 plots in three French wine growing regions (Champagne, Languedoc and Rho<SIC>ne valley). These agro-environmental gradients structuring weed communities according to their combinations of traits were highlighted using multivariate analysis (RLQ). The impacts of these filters on Community Weighted Means (CWM) and Community Weighted Variance (CWV) of weed communities were analysed using mixed and null modelling. Our results showed that spatio-temporal and weed management practice variables explained from 13% to 48% of the total variance of CWM (specific leaf area, maximum height, seed mass, flowering onset and duration and lateral spread). Region, seasonality and management practices explained 53%, 28% and 19% of CWM marginal variance, respectively. Weed management impacted CWM and CWV through two main gradients: (i) a soil disturbance gradient with high mechanical disturbance of soil in tilled plots and low mechanical disturbance in chemically weeded plots and (ii) a vegetation cover gradient with high vegetation abundance in mowed plots compared to barer soils in tilled and chemically weeded plots. In Languedoc, chemical weeding filtered weed communities with ruderal strategy trait values (low seed mass, small-stature) while mowed communities were more competitive (higher seed mass, higher stature and lower SLA). In Languedoc and Champagne, tillage favoured communities with high seed mass that increases the viability of buried seeds and high lateral spread values associated to the ability to resprout after tillage. This study demonstrated that trait-based approaches can be successfully applied to perennial cropping systems such as vineyards, in order to understand community assembly to better guide weed management practices.

Abstract: Spontaneous plant communities have undergone considerable constraints due to human-mediated changes. Understanding how plant communities are shifting in response to land management and climate changes is necessary to predict future ecosystem functioning and improve the resilience of managed ecosystems, such as agroecosystems. Using Mediterranean weed communities as models of managed plant communities in a climate change hotspot, we quantified the extent to which they have shifted from the 1980s to the 2020s in response to climate and management changes in vineyards. The weed communities of the same 40 vineyards in the Montpellier region were surveyed using the same protocol in spring, summer, and autumn, for two years, with a 40-year interval (1978-1979 vs. 2020-2021). In four decades, the annual range of temperatures (i.e., the difference between the warmest month's and the coldest month's mean temperatures) increased by 1.2 degrees C and the summer temperatures by 2 degrees C. Weed management diversified over time with the adoption of mowing that replaced the chemical weeding of interrows. Chemical weeding is now mostly limited to the area under the row. Current weed communities were 41% more abundant, 24% more diverse, and with a less even distribution of abundance across species than the 1980s communities at the vineyard level. Modern communities were composed of more annual species (57% of annual species in the 1980s vs. 80% in the 2020s) with lower community-weighted seed mass and were composed of fewer C4 species. They had higher community-weighted specific leaf area, higher leaf dry matter content, and lower leaf area than the 1980s weed communities. At the community level, the onset of flowering was earlier and the duration of flowering was longer in the 2020s. Climate change induced more stress-tolerant communities in the 2020s while the diversification of weed management practices favored less ruderal communities. This study shows that plant communities are shifting in response to climate change and that land management is a strong lever for action to model more diverse and eventually more desirable weed communities in the future.

Abstract: Background and Aims Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is the fifth most widely produced fruit in the world. Its cultivation, mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, raises a number of issues such as the irregular fruit production across years, phenological asynchronisms that lead to long periods of pest and disease susceptibility, and the heterogeneity of fruit quality and maturity at harvest. To address these issues, we developed an integrative functional-structural plant model that synthesizes knowledge about the vegetative and reproductive development of the mango tree and opens up the possible simulation of cultivation practices. Methods We designed a model of architectural development in order to precisely characterize the intricate developmental processes of the mango tree. The appearance of botanical entities was decomposed into elementary stochastic events describing occurrence, intensity and liming of development. These events were determined by structural (position and fate of botanical entities) and temporal (appearance dates) factors. Daily growth and development of growth units and inflorescences were modelled using empirical distributions and thermal time. Fruit growth was determined using an ecophysiological model that simulated carbon- and water-related processes at the fruiting branch scale. Key Results The model simulates the dynamics of the population of growth units, inflorescences and fruits at the tree scale during a growing cycle. Modelling the effects of structural and temporal factors makes it possible to simulate satisfactorily the complex interplays between vegetative and reproductive development. The model allowed the characterization of the susceptibility of mango tree to pests and the investigatation of the influence of tree architecture on fruit growth. Conclusions This integrative functional-structural model simulates mango tree vegetative and reproductive development over successive growing cycles, allowing a precise characterization of tree phenology and fruit growth and production. The next step is to integrate the effects of cultivation practices, such as pruning, into the model.

Abstract: This study is a contribution to the characterization of traditional agroforestry parklands in Lower Casamance. It aims at determining the diversity of species and the tree size structure in these parklands, as well as at identifying the threats to their sustainability, in order to assist decision making on natural resource conservation. To this end, 45 plots of 50x50m size were inventoried. In each plot, an exhaustive inventory of trees was performed, including species identification, height measurement and estimates of regeneration and mortality rates. Additionally, 116 stakeholders were interviewed about their management practices, the revenue they obtained from agroforestry parklands, and their opinion on the future of these parks. A total of 2739 Elaeis guineensis palm trees and 3948 trees from other species were observed in the 11.25ha studied. Hence a relative density of 40.96 individuals of E. guineensis ha(-1). The 63 species belonged to 51 genus within 23 botanical families. The analysis of tree communities indicated a strong role of human management on the species composition of parklands, with cultural value trees near the villages and wood production trees further away, and with some sites having more trees with medicinal uses. The distribution of tree sizes of E. guineensis and estimates of mortality and regeneration rates indicated that the population of palm trees is ageing and regeneration is too low to compensate mortality. Based on interviews, palm production is decreasing in the area, and causes of decline identified by the farmers were salinization, drought, illegal cutting, and bush fires, i.e., both natural and anthropogenic causes. In view of the importance of these parklands for the local economy and food security, better management of E. guineensis parklands is required to ensure their sustainability.

Abstract: The negative effects of fruit production during one cycle on reproduction during the following cycle are generally explained by two complementary processes: hormone synthesis and carbohydrate mobilization. Our study focused on mango (Mangifera indica L.) for which it has been shown that reproduction decreases and delays vegetative bud outgrowth. This, in turn, affects flowering and fruiting in the following cycle. Vegetative growth therefore plays a pivotal role in irregular fruit production patterns across consecutive years. Our aim was to decipher the respective roles of hormones and carbohydrates on the negative effects of reproduction on vegetative growth. We analyzed the changes in various hormone (auxin, cytokinin, abscisic acid) and carbohydrate (glucose, sucrose, starch) concentrations in terminal axes with vegetative and reproductive fates of two mango cultivars, Cogshall and Jose, characterized by different bearing patterns, across consecutive phenological periods during a growing cycle. Auxin concentrations were high in inflorescences, fruit peduncles and axes bearing inflorescences or fruit, suggesting auxin-induced inhibition of vegetative bud outgrowth in the flowering and fruiting axes. Moreover, growing fruits, which are strong sink organs, depleted carbohydrates from non-fruiting axes. During vegetative growth, this starch depletion probably contributed to decreasing the probability of and to delaying vegetative bud outgrowth of reproductive axes for Cogshall, and of reproductive and nonreproductive axes for Jose. Starch dynamics in quiescent and flowering growth units during early fruit growth and their starch concentrations at fruit maturity differed between the two cultivars, presumably in relation to the observed contrasted crop loads and/or to differences in photosynthetic capacity or carbohydrate allocation. These differences between the two cultivars in terms of starch concentration in terminal axes during vegetative growth could partly explain their different bearing patterns.

Abstract: The intensification of droughts due to climate change is a global concern, and many plant species face increasing water deficits. Understanding the role of phenotypic plasticity in plant adaptation to these changing conditions is crucial. This research focuses on Bromopsis erecta, a dominant perennial grass in European and Mediterranean grasslands, to predict its potential adaptation to climate change. We assessed plants from shallow and deep soils (i.e., with contrasting water reserves) of a Mediterranean rangeland in southern France, and tested the effect of six years of experimentally increased summer drought compared to the ambient conditions on plant traits, survival and abundance. In both field and common garden experiments, we measured water-related traits, including static traits under non-limiting water conditions, and dynamic traits, such as rates of trait variation during drought. Trait plasticity was determined as a reaction norm to increasing soil water stress and was tested against changes in B. erecta abundance over the past decade, including the study period. Trait plasticity was detected only for leaf dry matter content (LDMC), revealing that the resource strategy of B. erecta became more conservative over less than a decade with higher LDMC and leaf thickness according to the plant economic spectrum. No plasticity was found for osmotic potential or specific leaf area. The variability of other traits was ascribed to the possible lagging effect of previous water stress and was associated more with soil depth than with previous summer drought intensity. The abundance decline of B. erecta, which dropped from 20 % to around 5 % in shallow soils, was not associated with the plasticity of LDMC but was positively correlated with variations in leaf base membrane damage, meaning unexpectedly, that plants exposed to the most severe summer drought also had the most sensitive leaf base membranes, a possible sign of maladaptive trait plasticity in the population. This key trait response reveals boundaries to the adaptive capacity of this perennial grass to survive pluri-annual drought.

Abstract: Mediterranean ecosystems are predicted to undergo longer and more intense summer droughts. The mechanisms underlying the response of herbaceous communities to such drier environments should be investigated to identify the resilience thresholds of Mediterranean rangelands. A 5-year experiment was conducted in deep and shallow soil rangelands of southern France. A rainout shelter for 75 days in summer imposed drier and warmer conditions. Total soil water content was measured monthly to model available daily soil water. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP), forage quality, and the proportion of graminoids in ANPP were measured in spring and autumn. Plant senescence and plant cover were assessed in summer and spring, respectively. The experimental years were among the driest ever recorded at the site. Therefore, manipulated summer droughts were drier than long-term ambient conditions. Interactions between treatment, community type, and experimental year were found for most variables. In shallow soil communities, spring plant cover decreased markedly with time. This legacy effect, driven by summer plant mortality and the loss of perennial graminoids, led to an abrupt loss of resilience when the extreme water stress index exceeded 37 mm 10 day-1, characterized by a reduction of spring plant cover below 50% and a decreased ANPP in rainy years. Conversely, the ANPP of deep soil communities remained unaffected by increased summer drought, although the presence of graminoids increased and forage nutritive value decreased. This study highlights the role of the soil water reserve of Mediterranean plant communities in modulating ecosystem responses to chronically intensified summer drought. Communities on deep soils were resilient, but communities on shallow soils showed a progressive, rapid, and intense degradation associated with a loss of resilience capacity. Notably, indexes of extreme stress were a better indicator of tipping points than indexes of integrated annual stress. Considering the role of soil water availability in other herbaceous ecosystems should improve the ability to predict the resilience of plant communities under climate change.

Abstract: Meeting the UN's objective of developing sustainable agriculture requires, in particular, accompanying small farms in their agroecological transition. This transition often requires making the agrosystem more complex and increasing the number of crops to increase biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper introduces a flexible model based on Constraint Programming (CP) to address the crop allocation problem. This problem takes a cropping calendar as input and aims at allocating crops to respect several constraints. We have shown that it is possible to model both agroecological and operational constraints at the level of a small farm. Experiments on an organic microfarm have shown that it is possible to combine these constraints to design very different cropping scenarios and that our approach can apply to real situations. Our promising results in this case study also demonstrate the potential of AI-based tools to address small farmers' challenges in the context of the sustainable agriculture transition.

Abstract: Key Message This study contributed to understand the adaptation mechanism of low chilling peach cultivars in a mild winter region according to the contents and mobilization of carbohydrates during dormancy and resumption of growth. The understanding of the physiological processes that occur in the peach tree during the dormancy period in mild winter regions (MWR) is important for the selection of new cultivars more adapted to these regions. The aim of this study was to bring more elements to build mechanistic understanding of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) mobilization in one-year shoots of two low winter chilling peach cultivars, 'T. Beauty' and 'S. aurea', during the dormancy period and the resumption of growth in MWR and their interactions with blooming and leafing. It is hypothesized that these low chilling peach cultivars do not enter into deep endodormancy and are, therefore, able to respond to external cues of growth and development. Our results showed that the amount of starch reserve, the mobilization and the use of NSC by buds are not limiting for low chilling cultivars during dormancy period in mild winter regions.

Abstract: Limiting crop pests while favouring environmentally friendly practices is challenging. It is required to identify the main drivers of infestation for multiple pests at different scales. In particular, large scale approaches are missing, while they could contribute to increase the predictability of pest infestation. In this study, the French national Epiphyt dataset (part of the national epidemiological monitoring service) was used to assess the relative importance of weather and landscape drivers on the between-region variability in the level of occurrence of some agricultural pests. Using a regional resolution, we analysed the proportion of occurrence of slugs, cereal aphids and oilseed rape pests over 181 small agricultural areas ('regions') across France in 2018. The mean proportion of occurrence per region was 0.17 for slugs, 0.25 for cereal aphids and 0.61 for oilseed rape pests. Weather variables were more explanatory than landscape ones for the proportion of occurrence of slugs and oilseed rape pests while the two types of variables had a similar level of explanation for the regional proportion of aphid occurrence. Slugs were favoured by high winter temperatures, high soil wetness index and important proportions of hedgerows in the region but negatively influenced by high winter rainfalls. Cereal aphids and oilseed rape pests were negatively influenced by the regional proportion of grassland. Additionally, the winter air humidity and the proportion of perennial crops in the region decreased the proportion of occurrence of oilseed rape pests. We detected no effect of the proportion of host crop or the proportion of organic farming in the region. This study emphasises that, in line with findings derived from more local studies, weather characteristics are an important driver of the regional level of pest occurrence in arable fields; it also highlights that the proportion of grassland at the regional scale could be a key tool to design insect-pest suppressive landscapes.

Abstract: Reducing pesticide use while maintaining agricultural production is a key challenge. Ecological theory predicts that landscape simplification is likely to increase insect pest outbreaks and limit their control by natural enemies, and this situation could boost insecticide use. Some studies have indeed detected that simpler landscapes were associated with higher insecticide use, but very few have demonstrated that this association is caused by landscape effects on pest abundance. Here, we analysed insecticide use and pest pressure in response to landscape simplification across 557 arable farms across France. Accounting for potentially confounding covariates, we found that lower cover of hedgerows in the landscape, but not semi natural areas, were associated with higher on-farm insecticide use. We also found that greater hedgerow coverage was associated with lower aphid pest pressure. Specifically, increasing the landscape-scale cover of hedgerows from 1 % to 3 % meant that insecticide use was halved. These findings suggest that restoring hedgerow cover at the landscape scale should be targeted in order to speed-up the ecological intensification of agriculture.

Abstract: Alley cropping is the combination of tree rows and crop alleys. The tree row is covered by an understory vegetation strip (UVS), providing a beneficial habitat for many soil fauna, which could disperse through spillover to the crop alleys. However, such movements have never been directly studied. Our experiment investigated earthworm fluxes in the tree row vicinity using a trap technique, in a Mediterranean agroforestry alley cropping field cultivated with peas and planted with walnut trees. We assessed earthworm density at different distances from the UVS (0 m, 0.3 m, 1 m and 6 m) by hand sorting soil monoliths (25*25*30 cm) in spring 2019, at the start and the end of a two-month experiment. During this period, we detected earthworm fluxes by placing directional traps at 30 cm from the UVS border. Traps consisted of three glued plastic walls placed vertically in the soil. They delimited a soil block of 25*25 cm by 20 cm depth and were open on one side. More epigeic earthworms were found in the UVS and up to 30 cm from the UVS border than in the middle of the crop alley. By contrast, the earthworm Allolobophora chlorotica presented a homogeneous distribution in the plot. Trapped earthworms were mostly of the All. chlorotica species, and 1.6 times more earthworms were found in traps open towards the crop alley than in traps open towards the UVS. These results suggest that in spring, earthworms are moving more from the crop alley towards the UVS than in the other direction, probably using the tree row and its vicinity as a refuge against adverse summer conditions in the crop alley.

Abstract: Assessing benefits and limits of agroecological transitions in different contexts is of foremost importance to steer and manage agroecological transitions and to feed evidence-based advocacy. However, assessing agroecological transitions remains a methodological challenge. The objective of this research was to investigate to what extent existing multiscale and multidimensional assessment methods were suitable to assess agroecological transitions. We used a literature review to identify and select 14 existing multiscale and multidimensional assessment methods related to sustainable or resilient agriculture. We then analyzed these 14 methods according to five evaluation criteria that reflected key requirements for assessing agroecological transitions: 1) be adaptable to local conditions, 2) consider social interactions among stakeholders involved in the transitions, 3) clarify the concept of agroecology, 4) consider the temporal dynamics of the transitions to better understand barriers and levers in their development and 5) use a participatory bottom-up approach. The methods adopted different approaches to consider each evaluation criterion, but none of them covered all five. The two evaluation criteria most often employed were the adaptability to local conditions (used by 13 of the methods) and the consideration of social interactions (used by all 14 of the analyzed methods). To be adaptable, methods mobilized generic guidelines with flexible content and/or included a contextualization phase. For social interactions, most methods mobilized social-related indicators, and two included stakeholder mapping. Two methods clarified the agroecological concept by mobilizing different sets of principles. Two other methods considered temporal dynamics of the transitions, mobilizing a trajectory of change to understand barriers and levers in their development. Finally, seven methods adopted a bottom-up participatory approach, involving stakeholders in both their development and use. To balance the existing trade-offs between the evaluation purpose, the time requirement and the level of participation in the different approaches adopted by the 14 methods studied, we suggest combining some of the approaches in a complementary mode to cover all 5 criteria and therefore improve the assessment of agroecological transitions.

Abstract: Assessing the conditions and performance of agroecological transitions in different contexts is key to supporting these transitions. However, assessing agroecological transitions presents methodological challenges, including: 1) being adaptable to local conditions, 2) consideration of social interactions among stakeholders involved in transitions, 3) clarifying the concept of agroecology, 4) consideration of the temporal dynamics of the transitions to better understand barriers and levers in their development, and 5) using a participatory bottom-up approach. The objective of this research was to design a method that provided evidence on 1) the barriers and levers in the development of agroecological transitions, and 2) their performance related to four dimensions: techno-economic issues, agroecosystem health, quality of life and resilience. To design, test and adapt such a method, while also involving end-users, we adopted a co-design approach based on prototyping. The co-design approach unfolded in nine stages alternating research work and co-design with end-users. The prototype was built on the approaches of existing published methods covering the five challenges for assessing agroecological transitions. It consisted of a four chronological step assessment method. The first three steps consisted of framing the assessment, with the final step a multidimensional performance assessment, using an initial set of 73 indicators to cover the four dimensions. The prototype was then tested and adapted in the village of Sare Boubou, Senegal, which is going through an agroecological transition supported by a non-governmental organization. Changes during the testing and adaptation phase affected three steps of the prototype and allowed the initial prototype to adapt to the case study's specificities, related to its scale and context. Context-related changes particularly affected the performance assessment, with a total of 31 indicators changed. The analysis of barriers and levers revealed that the transition began 29 years ago, achieved a fair level of advancement and yet was still ongoing. Results revealed heterogeneity between the nine households of the village in terms of: uptake of agroecological practices, household resources, diversification of activities, coverage of food needs through production and level of sales. This heterogeneity explained the large variability in household multidimensional performances across all dimensions. Large disparities were also noticeable at the individual level between men, women and young men in the village regarding the level of education, empowerment and participation in knowledge sharing networks. Despite a method seen as time-consuming and data intensive, end -user validation acknowledged the comprehensiveness of the method and its usefulness for steering and managing agroecological transitions, making it possible to identify levers for action at different scales.

Abstract: Diversified systems are associated with greater resilience and sustainability, but are currently poorly understood. The aim of the study is to identify and characterise diversified systems as alternatives to the dominant model in olive and wine growing, using the innovation-tracking method. After defining the dominant system (bibliography, local advisers), the diversified systems were identified by interviewing 28 winegrowers and 18 olive growers using them. We distinguish three types of diversification: (1) with animals on sub-plots, (2) with perennial species mainly in the row or on the row, and (3) with annual species on the inter-row. Some associations are only possible in irrigated systems (market gardening). Diversification is mainly based on an existing plantation. For farmers, innovative systems meet environmental, agronomic and/or economic objectives. The majority of farmers were satisfied with their innovative systems, but mentioned specific disadvantages (e.g., harvesting difficulties in olive growing) that could be the subject of dedicated design work to adapt existing systems. A quarter of the winegrowers surveyed had received technical support in setting up their innovative system(s). No olive grower mentioned such support. All the farmers expressed this need to improve their systems and be reassured in their practices. Setting up an exchange network between farmers would be a first solution. It is also important to build references on the associations implemented in the plots, and to develop financial aid for diversification.

Abstract: In agroforestry systems, the canopy of maturing trees progressively reduces the radiation available for the crop. Tree management practices such as pollarding can be used to restore the crop light availability. We monitored durum wheat, barley and pea yields during three consecutive years in an alley-cropping agroforestry system with hybrid walnut trees in Southern France. Trees have been pruned regularly to 4 m since planting (in 1995), and a section of 50 trees was pollarded at 4 m height for the first time in 2013. We measured the yields and yields components in the two different tree management systems and in a sole crop control. The non-pollarded trees reduced significantly the incident light (around 80% of the global radiation left in average) and both wheat (68% of the control) and pea (69% of the control), but not barley mean yields. In pollards inter-row, the average incident light was 98% of the total radiation the first year and the wheat yield 89% of the control. But 3 years after pollarding, the incident light was 79% of the total radiation and the pea yield was only 67% of the control. Pollarding had a transient positive impact on crop yield; after 3 years, pollards were more competitive for light than control trees. Pollarding may also reduce the belowground trees competition, but slightly, as the crop vegetative growth occurs when the trees are leafless.

Abstract: The yield of crops in both agrivoltaic (AV) and agroforestry (AF) systems is difficult to predict. The shade pattern of an AV system is not typical and is quite different from the one of AF systems. Most countries allow AV systems on croplands only if the crop productivity is maintained (e.g., in France) or slightly reduced, as in Japan and Germany, with 80% and 66% minimum relative yield (RY) required, respectively. I suggest using the Ground Coverage Ratio (GCR: ratio of area of photovoltaic panels to area of land) as an indicator of the crop potential productivity in AV systems. The GCR can easily be computed and controlled for all kinds of AV systems with panels that are either fixed (horizontal, tilted, or vertical) or mobile (on 1- or 2-axis trackers). Here, I provide a synthesis of published data for crop productivity under AV systems. Only publications that provided both the GCR of the system and the crop RYs were included. Measuring RYs requires a reliable non-AV control plot. Several publications were excluded because of doubts regarding the measurements' validity (e.g., systems that are too small, resulting in strong edge effects, or unreliable control plots). Despite the scattering of results, a clear pattern is evidenced: RYs decrease rapidly when GCRs increase. It appears that a GCR < 25% is required to ensure that most crop RYs stay > 80%. These results are consistent with a recent meta-analysis examining the impact of shade on crops. The use of the GCR criterion to validate AV projects is a simple and cost-effective alternative to the tricky control of crop yields in the fields.

Abstract: Agroforestry, the intentional integration of trees with crops and/or livestock, can lead to multiple economic and ecological benefits compared to trees and crops/livestock grown separately. Field experimentation has been the primary approach to understanding the tree-crop interactions inherent in agroforestry. However, the number of field experiments has been limited by slow tree maturation and difficulty in obtaining consistent funding. Models have the potential to overcome these hurdles and rapidly advance understanding of agroforestry systems. Hi-sAFe is a mechanistic, biophysical model designed to explore the interactions within agroforestry systems that mix trees with crops. The model couples the pre-existing STICS crop model to a new tree model that includes several plasticity mechanisms responsive to tree-tree and tree-crop competition for light, water, and nitrogen. Monoculture crop and tree systems can also be simulated, enabling calculation of the land equivalent ratio. The model's 3D and spatially explicit form is key for accurately representing many competition and facilitation processes. Hi-sAFe is a novel tool for exploring agroforestry designs (e.g., tree spacing, crop type, tree row orientation), management strategies (e.g., thinning, branch pruning, root pruning, fertilization, irrigation), and responses to environmental variation (e.g., latitude, climate change, soil depth, soil structure and fertility, fluctuating water table). By improving our understanding of the complex interactions within agroforestry systems, Hi-sAFe can ultimately facilitate adoption of agroforestry as a sustainable land-use practice.

Abstract: A lot of national and international effort has been made to promote sustainable agricultural production systems in drylands. However, success has been seriously limited due to lack of thorough characterization of the impact of the diversity of farm household types on productivity, resource-use efficiency and economic and nutritional status. This study applied hierarchical ascendant classification to a random sample of 286 cereal-producing farm households in Morocco and identified distinct household typologies. It also carried out an analysis of trade-offs between economic, nutritional and environmental factors induced by the production decisions of the different farm household typologies. Our analysis identified three dominant farm household typologies in the production system, namely: (i) intensive predominantly-vegetable farming households with high input intensities, (ii) semi-intensive cereal mono-crop farming households with moderate input intensities and (iii) extensive mixed cereal-legume farming households with low input intensities. Extensive mixed cereal-legume farming households exhibited the highest resource-use efficiency and high biodiversity. These benefits, however, came at the expense of a much lower farm income and limited food supplies relative to the other two systems. These results show that, as is the case for many dryland regions, all three farm types showed precarious conditions for one or more of the sustainability-related indicators.

Abstract: CONTEXT: Farmers in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region face several interrelated challenges including natural resource depletion, low crop productivity, and food and nutrition insecurity. To address some of these challenges, governments are considering different incentives to increase crop production. However, incentives often entail trade-offs and may have diverging effects on economic, social, and environmental sustainability.OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the ex-ante effects of incentives targeted towards increasing crop production on the production and consumption decisions of farm households on the Salss plain of northern Morocco.METHODS: The assessment was conducted with a dynamic, intertemporal farm household model that simulates farm production and food consumption decisions. The model was calibrated using survey data from 85 farm households for 2014. Four scenarios were codesigned with local stakeholders and then simulated over a continuous 15-year period to capture rainfall variability: (1) increased availability of annual groundwater for irrigated cropping from 31 m3 ha-1 to 215 m3 ha-1, (2) a 15% increase in grain prices for cereals and legumes, (3) introduced drought tolerant crop varieties, and (4) a fourth scenario that combines all factors in the above three scenarios.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results showed that regardless of the scenario, the area of cereals and legumes cultivated only slightly changed compared to the Baseline scenario. However, according to the scenarios tested, the total production of cereals increased by 10% to 21% and of legumes increased by 2% to 9%. This production increase is the direct consequence of increased crop yields due to an intensification of crop production methods. The incentives increased the consumption of cereals and legumes by up to 43%. This increase was mainly due to a shift from grain to vegetable production that increases cash income, resulting in more food purchases from the market while consumption from own production dropped by up to 53%. The average increase in crop income was 14% in scenarios 1-3 and 28% in scenario 4. However, increased income had ramifications for nature resource stocks, with irrigation water use from groundwater increasing by 593% in the Water scenario and 320% in the combined scenario, relative to the Baseline scenario. In the Water scenario, incomes increased by 15% and nitrogen leached increased by 36%, highlighting the trade-off between economic and environmental sustainability.SIGNIFICANCE: These results show the challenges in obtaining acceptable compromises between the three sustainability pillars as the scenarios increased income but also led to increased groundwater extraction and nitrate leaching.

Abstract: CONTEXT: A large body of evidence suggests that landscape management may limit the use of pesticides in agricultural systems. However, this hypothesis is largely based on studies about biological pest control service, and the effects of landscape context on pesticide use remain poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated how the proportion of host crops and semi-natural habitats affected the local use of fungicides and insecticides in the most treated crops in France, i.e., apple orchards and vineyards. METHODS: Using pesticide use information at the national level from 64 apple orchards and 138 vineyards monitored between 2014 and 2019, we investigated how local field size, several aspects of landscape context (proportion of host crops, share of organic host crop, proportion of woodlands and grasslands) as well as the weather context affect the frequency, timing and diversity of local fungicide and insecticide use. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that landscape-scale management could reduce the use of insecticides in agricultural landscapes. In vineyards, a lower use of insecticides was observed in small fields or landscapes composed of a high proportion of woodlands, while in orchards a lower local use of insecticides was found in landscapes with a high share of organic orchards. Fungicide use was mainly affected by the weather context in both apple orchards and vineyards, with more fungicide use in humid and warm weather. However, effects of vineyard size and grassland proportion on the date of the first spray suggest that these two variables may impact pathogen spatial dynamics, a topic that needs further investigations. SIGNIFICANCE: Landscape-scale management options highlighted in our study may contribute to the design of functional agricultural landscapes minimising pesticide use.

Abstract: Often unable to fulfill theoretical production potentials and to obtain the maximum yields set by wine quality labels, many vineyards and cellars need to solve the issue of so-called grapevine yield gaps in order to assure their durability. These yield gaps particularly occur in Mediterranean wine regions, where extreme events have intensified because of climate change. Yield gaps at the regional level have been widely studied in arable crops using big datasets, but much less so in perennial crops, such as grapevine. Understanding the environmental factors involved in yield gaps, such as those linked to climate and soil, is the first step in grapevine yield gap analysis. At a regional scale, there are numerous studies on 'terroir' linked to wine typicity and quality; however, none have classified spatial zones based on environmental factors identified as being involved in grapevine yield. In the present study, we aggregated into one big dataset information obtained from producers at the municipality level in the wine region Languedoc-Roussillon (South of France) between 2010 and 2018. We used a backward stepwise model selection process using linear mixed-effect models to discriminate and select the statistically significant indicators capable of estimating grapevine yield at the municipality level. We then determined spatial zones by using the selected indicators to create clusters of municipalities with similar soil and climate characteristics. Finally, we analysed the indicators of each zone related to the grapevine yield gap, as well as the variations among the grapevine varieties in the zones. Our selection process evidenced 6 factors that could explain annual grapevine yield annually (R2 = 0.112) and average yield for the whole period (R2 = 0.546): Soil Available Water Capacity (SAWC), soil pH, Huglin Index, the Climate Dryness Index, the number of Very Hot Days and Days of Frost. The clustering results show seven different zones with two marked yield gap levels, although all the zones had municipalities with no or high yield gaps. On each zone, grapevine yield was found to be driven by a combination of climate and soil factors, rather than by a single environmental factor. The white wine varieties showed larger yield gaps than the red and rose wine varieties. Environmental factors at this scale largely explained yield variability across the municipalities, but they were not performant in terms of annual yield prediction. Further research is required on the interactions between environmental variables and plant material and farming practices, as well as on vineyard strategies, which also play an important role in grapevine yield gaps at vineyard and regional scale.

Abstract: 'Service plants' include spontaneous vegetation or sown species of cover crops associated with perennial crops in the rows or inter-rows with a high potential to provide ecosystem functions and services. In vineyards, service plants target specific services depending on the management strategy implemented by the winegrower, including the plant species, the surface covered, the plant growth control and destruction date. Understanding the management strategies linked to their associated target services at the regional scale is necessary to better help winegrowers, advisers and policy makers regarding an adapted use of service plants. To do this, we conducted a survey in 2016 among 334 winegrowers in Languedoc-Roussillon region in France, enquiring about their service plant management practices during the season 2014-2015. Given the diversity of the strategies of service plant management, we proposed a typology analyzing their spatial and temporal dimensions. Further, we present a Coverage Index (CI), which combines both temporal and spatial dimensions of the service plant management strategies. We conducted a multiple components analysis and clustering to create a vineyard typology and applied linear models to find correlations between the CI and specific vineyard characteristics. Three quarters of interviewed winegrowers sowed or maintained service plants in their vineyards; 41 % used a winter service plant strategy; 8.4 % a semi-permanent and 27.3 % a permanent service plant strategy. The preferred surface coverage strategy was full surface during grapevine dormancy and its reduction to half of the inter-rows after grapevine budburst. However, the diversity of surface coverage strategies during the grapevine vegetative period was remarkable. Lower water resources and specific soil characteristics were not linked to the service plant management strategies. Higher CI was associated with vineyards presenting quality labels (PDO and Organic), independent wine-making and lower target yields, showing that the added value of producing high quality wine plays an important role when implementing service plants in vineyards. Overall, our study showed: i) the popularity of spontaneous service plant strategies; ii) the spatial and temporal diversity of service plant management strategies and iii) the utility of the CI to study the implementation of service plants and to understand the motivations and constraints of their use.

Abstract: Agro-food networks are characterized by complex material exchanges among farms, processors, consumers, and waste managers involved in fertilization, food, feed and bioenergy production. Better coordination of material exchanges at the local scale can facilitate more efficient resource use. Here, we present a new agent-based model, "Flows in Agro-food Networks" (FAN), which simulates the processing and exchange of fertilizers, feed, food and wastes among farms and multiple upstream or downstream partners (feed and fertilizer suppliers, food industries, waste processors, and anaerobic digesters) in small farming regions. FAN includes a series of environmental indicators that can be used to assess alternative scenarios in terms of ecosystem services, nutrient cycling, and resource autonomy. We use a French case study to demonstrate FAN's dynamics and to explore the sensitivity of key parameters. We show a strong influence of spatial distance between agents, their disposition to exchange, and their preference for specific materials on local agro-food network simulations. FAN is powerful theoretical tool to explore and assess opportunities for a circular economy in small farming regions and to unravel interactions between recycling, environmental performance and food production.

Abstract: Realizing more sustainable food, feed, and bioenergy systems will require interventions such as increased recycling of nutrients and coordination of biomass flows among farms. Innovative tools to explore the co-benefits and trade-offs of improving flow circularity in agro-food systems at different scales are needed to better understand the efficacy of these sustainability solutions. Here, we applied the FAN ("Flows in Agro-food Networks") agent-based model to simulate contrasting scenarios of material flows locally in a small farming region of France. These scenarios aim to enhance: (1) best management practices at the farm scale; (2) organic material recycling and biogas production collectively across the agricultural landscape; and (3) system redesign toward complete local circularity through crop and livestock symbiosis, fewer livestock, and elimination of external inputs. Scenario simulation outcomes are assessed in terms of their degree of circularity and food production. We find that best management practices at the farm scale and collective solutions for recycling (organic fertilization and anaerobic digestion) substantially improved the degree of circularity by tightening the local nitrogen (N) cycle without affecting food production. Among other co-benefits, changes in farm rotations to feed livestock locally increased the degree of circularity without appreciably impacting food production. The maximum circularity scenario showed considerable potential to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however, they involved large trade-offs with food production that were even more pronounced with fewer livestock animals. Although regulating livestock numbers combined with eliminating chemical fertilizers was the most effective at mitigating GHG emissions, when applied simultaneously it substantially impacted food and bioenergy production. Such trade-offs for soil fertility demonstrate the importance of coupling crops and livestock for reaching self-sufficient circular systems. Our study illustrates how the FAN agent-based model can be applied to account for multiple types of interactions involved in transitions toward circularity in local agro-food systems, including the potential for co-benefits, and unintended consequences of interventions.

Abstract: The hypothesis of niche complementarity for the use of soil resources is crucial for the performance of agroforestry systems. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that roots of 2 years old peach trees intercropped with grass can extract deep soil water below a shallow lithic discontinuity, composed of a layer of pebbles in a powdery calcareous matrix and that hardens in dry conditions. A peach tree orchard was planted on a soil with an average 0.5 m deep lithic discontinuity. Soil water content was measured every fortnight on the row and the inter-row with a neutron probe every 0.2 m up to 3 m depth. The contribution of each soil layer to trees and grass transpiration was simulated with a dynamic water balance model. Results show that tree roots grew through the lithic discontinuity and accessed a water refilled soil layer beneath it only 2 years after plantation, whereas grass roots did not grow below 0.5 m. Soil water content decrease up to 2 m depth after the cessation of irrigation was analysed as the result of tree water uptake. Tree water uptake simulations showed that soil layers below 1 m can contribute up to 17% of the total water uptake of the 2 years old trees. Our results suggest that a lithic discontinuity such as the one in our study may not be an impediment to the perennial trees root growth allowing them to access deep soil water. This suggests that soils with such a lithic discontinuity may be suitable for dryland agroforestry in which deep soil water available to the trees may help in reducing competition for water.

Abstract: High quantities of pesticides are applied on vineyards. For example, the average treatment frequency index (TFI) for French vineyards was 13.5 in 2016, whereas the average TFI for wheat (a major annual crop in France) was 4.9 in 2017. Reducing pesticide use is a key issue to improve viticulture sustainability. The aims of this study were (i) to analyse the evolution of pesticide use in vineyard farms voluntarily participating in a pesticide reduction programme, and (ii) to understand the options winegrowers used to reduce their pesticide use. We analysed data from the DEPHY farm network, including 244 cropping systems followed over 10 years and spread across 12 winegrowing regions. We used the TFI to assess the intensity of pesticide use. Mean pesticide use within the network decreased over the 10-year period and mostly concerned fungicide use. By analysing several indicators such as the number of treatments and the mean TFI per fungicide treatment, we were able to identify some of the management options mobilised for achieving this pesticide reduction. The use of biocontrol products and the reduction of sprayed doses were often associated with a low TFI. The analysis of yield evolution showed a significant mean reduction, although it was smaller than the TFI reduction. This raised the question of the impact of pesticide reduction on productivity. Further trade-off analyses are required in the future.

Abstract: CONTEXT: Winegrowers apply large quantities of pesticides to their vineyards to reduce high cryptogamic pressure. But these practices must change to lower pesticide use and improve viticulture sustainability. Different options for curbing pesticide use exist, and they can be progressively implemented following a specific temporal scheme in each production system. Some change trajectories can be more efficient than others in limiting pesticide applications. Combining trajectory studies and typology may be helpful in characterizing how farmers change their practices and in summarizing the various production system trajectories possible when transitioning towards pesticide use reduction.OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were i) to identify different types of pesticide use trajectories, and ii) to understand the options implemented by winegrowers to reduce their pesticide use. METHODS: We analysed data from 161 farming systems in the DEPHY farm network in 12 French winegrowing regions over a 10-year period. Pesticide use was assessed with the treatment frequency index (TFI). We char- acterized the TFI trajectory of each farming system with six indicators and built a typology of TFI trajectories. We then analysed several indicators such as the use of biocontrol products and the dose sprayed to identify some of the management options chosen to achieve these pesticide use trajectories.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Three clusters were identified and characterized in terms of pesticide use strat- egy. The first cluster represented farms with an initial point close to the regional average and which did not experience a significant TFI reduction (-13%). The second cluster comprised farms with a low TFI when entering the network that were able to further reduce their TFI over time (-48%). The last cluster represented farms with a high initial TFI and a high reduction (-63%). All clusters managed to reduce their pesticide use by combining several technical levers at different intensities. Some differences in the levers between clusters were observed. Cluster 2 farms are in the process of converting to organic farming and using the associated levers such as biocontrol and mechanical weeding. SIGNIFICANCE: The changes implemented by cluster indicate a varying degree of progress in the transition to- wards pesticide use reduction. The initial point was identified as having a strong influence on the end result. The more intensively the technical levers were combined, the more difficult it was to reduce pesticide use. The DEPHY network supported winegrowers in their reduction of pesticides who managed to reduce their pesticide use by 13% to 63%.

Abstract: Pesticides remain the most efficient way to control pest and disease pressure in vineyards and obtain satisfactory yields in terms of quality and quantity. However, because of the harmful effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, winegrowers have had to change their practices. To reduce pesticide use, winegrowers have a range of levers at their disposal that are implemented at different spatial and temporal scales and with different intensities of change. Beyond simply reducing pesticide use, these changes can also impact farms' economic and social performances notably because vine is a perennial crop with inertia in the impacts of changes operated. In this work, we assessed the covariation between various performances with time. We used the Agrosyst database, which compiles data on the performances of French vineyard cropping systems engaged in a pesticide reduction process for the past 10 years, implementing a reduction of 34%. Based on existing knowledge on transition processes and pesticide reduction in vineyards, we used partial least squares path modelling (PLSPM) to assess the dynamic trade-offs between different performances during the pesticide use reduction process. We verified the model we built (GoF = 0.44) and found no significant correlation between pesticide reduction, economic performances (operating costs and fuel consumption), technical performance (mechanical work time) or productivity (yield). Interestingly, we did not observe any effect from reducing fungicides on yield. We only noticed a significant correlation between the initial weed control strategy and the change in weed control strategy (beta = 0.18). Furthermore, stopping herbicide use did not affect mechanical work time or costs. Our results are encouraging in terms of maintaining both agronomic and economic performances when reducing pesticides in vineyards.

Abstract: Vineyards are an appropriate model for testing the filtering effect of management practices on weed communities, as a wide range of practices (tillage, herbicides and mowing) is implemented. The aim of this study is to highlight which trait values are selected by each practice in different environmental conditions, with special references to Grime's CSR strategies. A combination of a multivariate analysis (RLQ) and the fourth-corner analysis was used to analyse 400 floristic samples belonging to 100 vineyards in the wine-growing region of Bordeaux (France). The main structure of vineyard weed communities was shaped by the opposition between mowing, favouring hemicryptophytes with a competitive strategy, and soil tillage, favouring therophytes and nutrient-demanding species with a ruderal strategy. Secondly, the vineyard weed communities differed according to the trophic status of the soil. Vineyards on acidic, sandy soils with low organic matter were characterised by small-seeded annuals with a stress-tolerant strategy whereas vineyards with clayey, calcareous soils rich in organic matter, harboured larger perennial nitrophilous species with large seeds and a competitive strategy. Our study is the first to show that weed species responded consistently to two independent gradients with specific traits associated with disturbance (life cycle and SLA) and soil resources (plant height and seed mass) gradients. Based on knowledge of the soil characteristics, it becomes possible to predict which type of weeds will develop according to the combination of practices applied on the vineyard rows and inter-rows.

Abstract: Understanding the relative importance of spatial, temporal variables, environmental conditions and management practices as filters for weed assemblages is essential to promote biodiversity in agrosystems. In this study, we used a unique data set covering 46 vineyard plots in France (Champagne, Beaujolais and Languedoc winegrowing areas) with 883 flora surveys performed between 2006 and 2012. The three objectives of the present study were: (1) to characterize weed communities composition and structure (richness and abundance) in vineyards from three traditional winegrowing areas in France; (2) to evaluate the relative importance of spatial, temporal variables, environmental conditions and management practices on weed species composition and structure; (3) to determine whether or not weed composition and structure are affected by the same factors. The results of the study revealed that season (including timing of management practices) was the most important filter for weed communities in vineyards, opposing in each plot a spring community and a summer-autumn community. Furthermore, spatial variations between regions (latitude), soil types (pH) and inter-annual variations (2006 to 2012) were also seen to have a strong effect on species turnover. Farming practices explained an overall low variation in composition of weed communities but some species showed a high and consistent fit to contrasting practices. For example, herbicide applications (mostly glyphosate) promoted some species such as Malva sylvestris and Sorghum halepense whereas tillage in inter-rows selected typical annual weeds such as Cerastium glomeratum and Galium aparine. Farming practices had a much higher influence on species richness and abundance with equal effect of both herbicides and soil tillage for controlling weed species richness and abundance in inter-rows, but stronger effects of herbicides were observed on species abundance in the rows. Tillage along the rows and a combination of mowing and tillage along the inter-rows were associated to the highest level of weed richness and abundance. Our study suggests that grapevine growers have a limited ability to influence species composition (mostly determined by abiotic factors) but their choice of management can modulate the level of weed richness and abundance. Our results will contribute to guide farmers towards more integrated management practices, ensuring both an optimal management of the spontaneous vegetation in vineyards and allowing this vegetation to provide various ecosystem services.

Abstract: AimsThe aim of this study was to explore the impact of soil management strategies and the contribution of root traits of plant communities and soil organic carbon (SOC) in explaining soil aggregate stability in vineyards.MethodsWe measured topsoil aggregate stability, soil properties and root traits of 38 plant communities in an experimental vineyard, previously subjected to different soil management strategies. Then we investigated statistical relations between aggregate stability, root traits and SOC and estimated root trait and SOC contributions to gain insight into aggregate stability.ResultsSoil management strategies strongly affected soil aggregate stability, with a negative effect of tillage, even after several years of service crop cover. Among the investigated parameters, soil organic carbon was found to contribute the most to aggregate stability. Root mean diameter and root mass density showed positive correlations with aggregate stability, while specific root length showed a negative correlation with aggregate stability.ConclusionsSoil aggregate stability is the result of complex interactions between soil management strategies, soil properties and plant root traits. Service crops improve aggregate stability, and a trait-based approach could help to identify service crop ideotypes and expand the pool of species of interest for providing services in agroecosystems in relation with the soil physical quality.

Abstract: The trait-based approach can address questions in order to understand how the functioning of organisms scales up to that of ecosystems and controls some of the services they deliver to humans, including in agriculture. However, the importance of interspecific vs the intraspecific trait variability (ITV) for classifying species according to their traits in agrosystems on a large diversity of pedoclimatic situations and cropping systems remains still open. Here, we addressed three questions: How do measured traits vary across years and seasons? Are species rankings conserved across years and season? And which traits and species are the more stable and repeatable for sown and spontaneous species? We conducted a two-year experiment in a vineyard, and we measured four leaf and plant functional traits of 14 sown species and 43 spontaneous species that grew among sown species. Traits were measured at two key phenological stages for grapevine: budburst and flowering during two successive years with contrasted rainfall (2017 and 2018). We studied seasonal and interannual trait variations, rankings between species, and variance partitioning. The species factor explained the greatest part of trait variations across years and seasons. Sown and spontaneous species traits varied in the same way, and traits related to plant dry matter contents were the more stable across periods. Moreover, species rankings were conserved across years and seasons for all traits except plant height. Sown species showed better ranking conservation than spontaneous species overall. The trait-based approach seems promising for the comparison of various cropping systems involving sown and spontaneous species, and may help identifying service crop species related to specific agroecosystem services. Further research is needed to bring more knowledge on trait variations under a diversity of agrosystems, and to improve theoretical frameworks that would help the design of sustainable agrosystems that provide multiple ecosystem services.

Abstract: Soil management and particularly service crops are a promising solution for addressing current challenges in viticulture as they limit the use of herbicides while increasing potential ecosystem services. Scientific literature barely considers the importance of service crop management to reach trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices. This study evaluates during a three-year experiment, 6 service crop termination strategies for winter service crops, combining two service crops termination periods (early termination in February vs. termination at grapevine budburst) and three termination methods (mower (M), mower + tillage (T), roller-crimper (R)). Service crop (biomass, C:N ratio, weeds, and mulch following termination), soil ( soil organic matter, microbial biomass, and water and nitrogen stocks), and grapevines (predawn leaf water potential, yield components, delta 13C, yeast assimilable nitrogen in juice, and pruning weight) were monitored from 2019 to 2022. Allowing service crops to develop until the budburst of the vine resulted in a two to three-fold increase in biomass compared to early destruction. Termination involving soil tillage was the most effective method, as treatments destroyed early with soil tillage exhibited almost no regrowth. Soil tillage termination led to the lowest biomass of weeds at the grapevine flowering two years out of three, and prevented the regrowth of certain sown plants, especially Poaceae. The roller was less effective in destroying service crop species but was the best method for maintaining plant residues on the soil surface. A higher soil microbial biomass was observed with termination at budburst, combined with no-till termination methods. Termination involving soil tillage was notably more effective in stopping service crop transpiration, increasing soil water stocks and improving grapevine water status. In 2020 and 2022, soil inorganic nitrogen stocks were almost 4 times higher in the T treatments compared to the other two termination methods, achieving a level of approximately 61 kg ha-1 that closely corresponds to the annual nitrogen requirements of grapevines. The yeast-assimilable nitrogen (YAN) content in grape juice mirrored this trend. Pruning weight varied significantly between different termination methods, with T treatments exhibiting a higher pruning weight per vine in comparison to R and M treatments. In general terms, the T treatment had a significantly higher number of bunches, the M treatment had the lowest, and the R treatment exhibited intermediate values. Overall, the average grapevine yield ranged from 7.25 to 13.7 t ha-1, corresponding to 52-98 hL ha-1 (with 4000 vines ha-1, 140 kg hL-1). This level of production may be accepted for Protected Designations of Origin that limit grapevine yield to 40 or 60 hL ha-1, but it could be a limitation for Protected Geographical Indications, which permit 90 hL ha-1, or unlabeled productions without yield limitations. Given the Mediterranean climate context, with rising frequencies of dry winters due to climate change, termination involving soil tillage appears to be the least risky strategy to preserve grapevine vigor and production while improving soilbased ecosystem functions. However, this might be contingent on the targeted yield and wine valuation.

Abstract: Aims In vineyards, service crops may increase water infiltration and positively contribute to soil water refilling, but may also increase the risk of competition for water with grapevines which could impair grape yield over several years. This study aimed to test the relationships between service crop functional traits and two related services of major interest in viticulture: runoff control and water provisioning. Methods We measured the water stock, the cover rate, along with above- and belowground functional markers of 38 plant communities after a winter growing season in an experimental vineyard, to assess relationships between service crop functional markers, runoff control and water provisioning. Results Both aboveground and belowground functional markers were significant predictors of service provision at the community level. The plant aboveground dry matter content was positively related to soil water stocks and negatively related to the cover rate of the communities, while the specific leaf area (SLA) was positively related to the cover rate. The rooting depth and morphological root traits (specific root length and very fine root fraction) were negatively related with the soil water stock. Moreover, these results agree with ecological theories about the relationships between plant functional markers, plant ecological strategies and resources use. Conclusions The identification of functional markers related to service provision may help us to select species or communities service crops that could perform interesting trade-offs between multiple services due to a suited combination of related markers, and provide insights for plant selection in order to breed plant varieties and cultivars with the aim of providing agroecosystem services.

Abstract: Deep placement of urea in the form of supergranules is often recommended in transplanted rice cultivation as a means of avoiding nitrogen loss in the environment. As ammoniacal nitrogen produced by urea hydrolysis just after deep application is chemically stable in the anaerobic layer of the paddy soil, it is relevant to study the diffusion-exchange phenomenon affecting this ammoniacal-N. More precisely, numerical calculus was called on to solve the nonlinear diffusion-exchange equation, admitting spherical symmetry in this context. The adsorption isotherm for ammoniacal-N intervening in this equation was a Freundlich isotherm. Experiments performed in the laboratory (untransplanted situation) and in the field (transplanted situation) enabled the monitoring of the time course of ammoniacal-N concentration in the central position. The tortuosity factor was evaluated at 0.80 in the paddy soil. In the field, the diffusion-exchange phase was clearly separated from the ammonia assimilation phase. The limit between the two was evaluated in six replicates. The first-order mechanism of ammonia disappearance is interpreted as the indication of a tight physiological regulation at the carbon-nitrogen interface acting within roots pushed to their limit in growth and assimilative capacity. This limit is here reported at 12 mM ammonia, attained 39 d after point application. This delay is enhanced when the tortuosity factor is reduced. Similar modelling in the context of cylindrical symmetry can be an option to study new urea fertilizers in the form of urea rods.

Abstract: Biodiversity presence in perennial agroecosystems increases the provision of ecosystem services (ES). Weeds are known to deliver supporting or regulating services but their potential to provide provisioning services is less studied. Our study aims to quantify the potential of weeds to provide forage resources for livestock in two Mediterranean perennial agroecosystems: olive groves and vineyards. We used a trait-based approach to investigate the abiotic determinants of weed quality and quantity variations at both the species and community levels. We surveyed spontaneous vegetation in 16 vineyards and 16 olive groves in the French Mediterranean region with contrasting pedoclimatic conditions and agricultural practices, during spring and fall 2021. Four leaf traits were measured: Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC), Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Leaf Nitrogen Content (LNC) and leaf C/N ratio (Leaf C/N) and four forage potential indicators: dry matter digestibility (DMD), crude proteins (CP), neutral detergent fiber content (NDF) and aboveground biomass (AB). We found that DMD of perennial agroecosystems weeds is high (689 +/- 116 g kg-1), and can be compared to those of forage species. Using linear mixed models and path analysis, we found that, at the community scale, LDMC is negatively linked to weed forage quality and that disturbing agricultural practices like tillage, increase weed forage quality. However we did not find any effect of agricultural practices or pedoclimate on weeds leaf traits or on weeds quantity. Our results revealed the potential of weeds as highly digestible forage resources for livestock. The long-term aim is to promote the integration of livestock in perennial cropping systems in order to reduce the use of herbicides and/or tillage and to diversify agricultural production.

Abstract: Weed species are ecological models that recently received considerable attention due to their particular strategies linked to their ruderal-competitive traits. They are known to have the potential to provide additional floral resources for insects in flower-poor agroecosystems. However, their floral traits are much more scarcely studied than those of plants found in other habitats, such as grasslands. The aim of this study was to describe the floral phenotype of weeds and to determine to what extent their floral traits match their ecological strategies as described based on leaf traits. We cultivated 19 forb weeds from perennial agroecosystems, previously identified in Mediterranean fields, in a greenhouse for seven months and collected data on 12 floral and five leaf traits. We tested whether these traits covaried and exhibited an ecological strategy at the phenotype scale. We found that in matters of flower production, weed species face a tradeoff: either numerous small, low-stature flowers with small quantities of pollen and nectar, or few, large, higher-held flowers with more pollen and nectar. The floral traits were found to reflect Grime's CSR strategies: the weed species producing fewer but costlier flowers belonged to C-strategy species, whereas those producing more but less costly flowers belonged to species dominated by an R strategy. These findings indicate that the potential of weeds as floral resources for insects is related to their ecological strategies, which are known to be affected by agricultural practices that filter species composition. This implies that, as for the provision of other ecosystem services, weed communities can be managed to select species with floral traits matching the requirements of flower-visiting insects like pollinators or parasitoid wasps.

Abstract: Lack of floral resources is suspected to be one of the factors involved in flower-visiting insect declines. Because agricultural landscapes are often poor in flowers, it seems crucial to assess weeds as floral resources to feed flower-visiting insects and to identify the factors that drive floral productivity, defined as floral biomass produced by the weed community. We monitored floral presence, productivity and traits in 16 olive groves from September 2021 to June 2022. The objectives were to understand to which extinct abiotic factors, among agricultural practices, pedoclimate and weather, determine floral productivity and to analyse the relationships between floral traits, floral presence and productivity. We found mowing frequency (2-3 per year on average) increased mean floral area and height, advanced flowering onset, and increased floral functional diversity and flowering species richness, which in turn increased floral presence and productivity.

Abstract: Soil microbial communities in Mediterranean agroecosystems experience long drought periods that are typically combined with heat and frequently interspersed with rapid rewetting events. Agroforestry systems are of growing interest and viewed as possible alternative to conventional cropping systems in the context of climate change. Our aim was to evaluate the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities against drought with or without heat stress at different distances from the tree row in an agroforestry system as compared to a conventional cropping system. Soils were sampled at several distances from the tree row in a 21-year-old walnut agroforestry system and a contiguous conventional crop in Southern France. We simulated two cycles of drying-rewetting under controlled conditions and applied three distinct treatments: control (without stress), drought and drought combined with heat stress. We monitored microbial respiration over the incubation period. The inorganic N and microbial biomass C, N and P contents (MBC, MBN and MBP) were assessed during the drying period (resistance), just after rewetting and at the end of the experiment (resilience), while bacterial and fungal abundances were measured at the end of the resistance period. We demonstrated that an agroforestry system can induce spatial heterogeneity in soil microbial biomass and functions under control conditions. Microbial biomass and activity, soil organic matter (SOM) and mineral N levels increased on the tree row. This spatial heterogeneity pattern was preserved for soil microbial response to drought combined or not with heat. Microorganisms sampled in the middle of the interrow or in the conventional crop exhibited highest biomass resistance and lowest resilience when facing combined drought and heat stress. Soil microbial biomass resistance and resilience were similar whatever the spatial position when microorganisms had to deal with drought stress only. Our findings suggested that despite higher SOM content, microbial biomass and activity at and near the tree row, the legacy effect of the tree row did not lead to higher ecological stability under stressful climatic conditions. We also demonstrated that soil microorganisms can considerably change their stoichiometry depending on the stress treatment. Soil microorganisms showed elevated MBC:MBN, MBC:MBP and variable MBN:MBP during the resistance period. A high stoichiometric flexibility of microorganisms was observed when exposed to drought stress only, while stoichiometric changes were irreversible when exposed to combined drought and heat stress.

Abstract: Agriculture today faces opposing challenges: reducing its environmental impacts while feeding a growing pop-ulation and adapting to climate change. Diversification of cropping systems has been proposed as a solution to address these issues and promote sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. While alternatives have been proposed by research and development, changing the agricultural systems remains a huge challenge. Engaging local actors when considering those changes is important for their successful implementation. While co-designing with stakeholders is gaining interest in the scientific community, approaches that consider varying local contexts remain uncommon. In this study, our aim was to co-design, during workshops with local stakeholders, diver-sification options in five case studies located in the Mediterranean countries of Algeria, France, Greece, and Spain. Prior to the co-design process, we conducted a SWOT/PESTLE analysis in each case study to analyze the local context of current and potential agricultural systems. Our hypothesis was that co-designed systems would differ between case studies, according to their environmental, social and political contexts leading to fine-tuned locally ad hoc systems. Options for intercropping and diversifying rotations were considered for both cereal -based systems and vine systems. Additionally, these options included adapted management practices for cereal-based systems and more innovative diversification, such as photovoltaic panels or agroforestry, for vine systems. While some of these options could serve as adaptations to climate change, they may not be sufficient to address future climate conditions. Interestingly, we did not observe significant differences among the system options designed for the various case studies, even though the local contexts were very different. Indeed, options only partially addressed the issues identified by stakeholders: primarily, economic and environmental threats. This study points to the advantage of participatory research in diverse contexts along with cross-case analyses, and to the need to consider the future of these Mediterranean regions, where crop diversification is limited by water deficit. To foster the transition next steps should consider assessing experimentally these systems with farmers to stimulate learning, while considering market possibilities.

Abstract: The Mediterranean region is expected to be a hotspot for climate change, making the resilience of farming systems a major challenge. Some studies have used quantitative models at the farm scale to analyze the resilience of farming systems but with little involvement of stakeholders. We used a participatory approach with local actors on the Sais plain of Morocco to design possible future states and qualitatively assess the resilience of typical farm types (FTs) experiencing major change. Our approach combined individual interviews of farmers and local actors, mainly public, with participatory collective meetings to identify representative FTs and their performance, project their evolutions and future performance in the face of change, and evaluate their resilience. Performance, defined according to literature, interviews and meetings, included different types of capital, income, yields, markets, support of public policies, and water access. Four FTs were considered: highly irrigated horticulture (FT1), rainfed cereals (FT2), partly irrigated cereal-legumes (FT3), and mostly irrigated fruit-tree/horticulture (FT4). The primary driver for FT2 and FT3 was climate change; for FT1 and FT4, it was limiting access to water resources. Participants designed more diversified systems for all FTs in relation to those changes. Rankings of FT performance did not change between current and future states. Performance did not evolve significantly, but FT4 was seen as the most resilient and FT2 the least. These qualitative results differ somewhat from other studies mobilizing quantitative approaches, but they highlight the potential of local adaptation to limit the impacts of global change on vulnerable agriculture.

Abstract: Separation of water absorption by roots between trees and crops is critical to intercropping in water-limited regions. The current knowledge about interspecific water relationship is in one dimension, i.e., the vertical direction, little is known in both vertical and horizontal directions under different rainfall conditions. Therefore, an experiment was carried out in an apple tree based intercropping system and an apple tree monoculture on China's Loess Plateau during one growing season which started with a high rainfall period followed by a low rainfall period. We investigated the spatial distribution of soil water and plant root, and simulated their water use strategies using the 3D Hi-sAFe model. The root growth of apple trees in the top 60 cm was restricted by intercropping in the cropped area but increased in the top 40 cm in the uncropped area compared with monoculture. In the high rainfall period, compared with the control, the apple trees' water absorption from the uncropped area (0-60 cm) increased by 44.43%, but the water utilization from the cropped area (0-60 cm) decreased by 32.59%. More than 90% of the soil water absorbed by B. napus came from the 0-60 cm soil layer in the cropped area. During the low rainfall period, intercropping promoted an increase of 14.79% in apple trees' water absorption from the 60-100 cm soil layer in the cropped area. The soil water in the 20-60 cm layer became the main source for B. napus and its contribution was 63.51%, but only 20.56% of the water absorbed by apple trees came from here. It can be concluded that, to alleviate water competition, water absorption between species was segregated horizontally during the wet period due to the roots "niche differentiation", while water use complementarity occurred along the vertical axis during the dry period.

Abstract: Pruning tree roots in alley cropping systems (ACS) could reduce underground competition and thus increase crop productivity. However, these management operations impose a stress on the trees, increase production costs and given the complexity of ACS; they may not lead to an increase in crop yield. Thus, the objective of this study was to measure the impact of root pruning in a Mediterranean ACS on soil water content and on the yield of two varieties each of barley and durum wheat. To achieve this, an experiment with three different treatments was conducted: monocrop (MC), and two 23-year-old hybrid walnut ACS, with (ACS_RP +) and without (ACS_RP-) root pruning. In each system, grain yield and yield components were measured and the microclimate and soil water content were recorded during the growing season. The ACS had lower incident radiation in the understory than MC and this radiation was unevenly distributed along the alley. Besides, ACS had lower air temperature during the day and higher at night in comparison with MC. Also, soil water content was higher in ACS than in MC. Within ACS, the soil water content was similar until the tree budburst but thereafter lower in ACS_RP-. The grain yield of both cereals was lower in ACS than in MC. Among the ACS there were no differences in grain yield or in any yield component for both cereals. From the above, it can be concluded that, under the conditions presented in the study, the root pruning increased the water available for the crops, but this did not increase crop yield. It is inferred that the main limiting factor for grain yield in the studied ACS was other than soil water.

Abstract: Smallholder farmers, who mostly engage in low-value agriculture in the drylands of Northern Africa, were the first to have felt the effects of climate change, with threats to their livelihoods and food security. The increasing costs of agricultural production, poor water and energy infrastructure, loss of agricultural land due to urban expansion, fragmented resource management, and unsustainable management practices all contribute to this vulnerability to climate change. This highlights the urgent need for innovative practices in farming systems. Within the framework of the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus, this paper explores innovative practices in dryland farming systems, by assessing their impact on water, energy, food, and ecosystem through stakeholder perception. In this work, we aim to present a systems approach for assessing the resilience of the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus in arid and semiarid regions. By using a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) approach, the study-which focuses on the F & egrave;s-Mekn & egrave;s region in Morocco-involves local actors to help researchers identify the key variables in order to assist farmers in their adaptation to climate change. The findings revealed different priorities between farmers and other stakeholders regarding the adoption of agricultural innovations. Farmers prioritize innovations that guarantee higher profitability and more market opportunities, such as integrating olive trees with cereal crops, by highlighting the importance of sustainable income sources. Meanwhile, stakeholders, such as researchers, engineers, government officials, and agribusiness entrepreneurs, prioritize innovations that emphasize high water use efficiency, which is crucial for the resilience of dryland farming areas: for instance, rainwater harvesting or the use of drought-resistant crop varieties that directly address the need for water conservation. But in doing so they are overlooking broader aspects within the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus.

Abstract: Agroforestry systems are complex due to the diverse interactions between their elements, and they develop over several decades. Existing numerical models focus either on the structure or on the functions of agroforestry systems. However, both of these aspects are necessary, as function influences structure and vice versa. Here, we present a representation of agroforestry systems based on combinatorial maps (which are a type of multidimensional graphs), that allows conceptualizing the structure-function relationship at the agroecosystem scale. We show that such a model can represent the structure of agroforestry systems at multiple scales and its evolution through time. We propose an implementation of this framework, coded in Python, which is available on GitHub. In the future, this framework could be coupled with knowledge based or with biophysical simulation models to predict the production of ecosystem services. The code can also be integrated into visualization tools. Combinatorial maps seem promising to provide a unifying and generic description of agroforestry systems, including their structure, functions, and dynamics, with the possibility to translate to and from other representations.

Abstract: Climate influence on grapevine physiology is prevalent and this influence is expected to increase with climate change. Climate influence on grapevine physiology can vary depending on the terroir. A better understanding of these local terroir variations is likely to be achieved with analyses that use local data; i.e., farm/vineyard data. Thus, the challenge lies in exploiting farm data to enable grape growers to understand their own terroir and consequently adapt their practices to the local conditions. In such a context, this article proposes an analytical process to site-specifically study climate influence on grapevine physiology by focusing on time series of the weather data often contained in farm data sets. This article focuses on temperature and precipitation influence on yield in the form of a case study. The analytical process includes the Extended Growing Degree Days (eGDD) and the Bayesian functional Linear regression with Sparse Steps functions (BLiSS) methods in order to detect site-specific periods of strong climate influence on grapevine yield. It uses data from three commercial vineyards situated in the Bordeaux region (France), California (USA) and Israel. In general, the periods of climate influence on grapevine yield detected for the three vineyards identified the same stages of yield development, which have already been studied in the scientific literature. However, some vineyard differences were observed, including: i) different periods of influence associated with a given stage of yield development between the vineyards, ii) different influential weather variables between the three vineyards for a given period, and iii) differing duration of the period of influence associated with a given stage of yield development between the vineyards. These results show the potential of the proposed analytical process for analysing the time series of farm weather data in order to extract site-specific climate indicators of grapevine yield.

Abstract: Grapevine yield is defined as the quantity of harvest, expressed as either grape mass or wine volumeunits, which has been collected per surface unit are and per crop cycle. The information about current and future yield, termed a yield assessment in this paper, is an essential decision-making element for the grape and wine industry. Crop management, wine-making, commercial, accounting and strategic operations are all adapted to and all impact on the expected yield of the current vintage. Numerous yield assessment approaches have been proposed in the scientific literature. However, only a few of them have considered their adaptation to the operational context under the constraints, needs and strategies of commercial vineyards and wineries. The few studies that have worked on the operational implementation of yield assessment methods have only partially addressed this issue, concentrating their improvement efforts on a single step in the yield assessment process. This paper first proposes to review the characteristics of yield development in an operational context that must be taken into account by yield assessment methodsThese characteristics are consolidated into three main challenges for yield assessment methods: (i) addressing the complex temporality of yield development, (ii) ensuring a local monitoring of yield development and (iii) fitting to the operational needs and constraints to allow for relevant decision support systems in the field. The approaches of yield estimation, prediction and forecast are discussed in the context of these challenges. In a second step, the paper proposes a generic framework for the yield assessment process, including a review of the variables that are used to explain grapevine yield. Issues and proposals from the literature associated respectively with measurement, sampling and yield modelling are reviewed and the need for improved modelling of relationships between explanatory variables and the desired, reported yield variable is discussed. The yield assessment methods found in the literature are categorised and compared according to measurement, estimation and modelling approaches, and then according to the three challenges identified for yield assessment in operational conditions, such that the yield assessment method is adapted to commercial needs and not to research objectives. In conclusion, concrete proposals for new grape yield assessment methods are discussed in order to investigate the as yet unexplored opportunities for the improvement in yield assessment in operational contexts that have been identified in the paper. These considerations could easily be transposed to other perennial crops.

Abstract: In precision agriculture, most spatio-temporal analyses involve the analysis of time series of remotely-sensed images whose dates are expressed according to the Gregorian calendar. However, in the agronomic literature, it is commonly accepted that calendars based on a thermal index allow a better representation of the actual state of development of the plant. This paper aims to demonstrate that potential new information at the block scale can be revealed by adjusting a NDVI time series extracted from Sentinel 2 images using a site-specific thermal index. This is achieved by removing part of the inter-annual differences in the time-series that is due to variations in phenology by using a temperature-based time adjustment. To do so, the paper is based on an operational case study in viticulture exploring whether a link between NDVI profiles and the consistency over years of harvest quality parameters could be hypothesised at the block scale.

Abstract: The majority of the research in apple tree architecture and physiology over the past decades is based on trees grown in mono-cultivar high -density orchards. Here we propose to connect knowledge on the tree itself with knowledge on the system in which it is grown. In both cases, scientific advances are intrinsically connected with practical aspects. It is first shown that although whole -tree shape variability presents a descriptive interest it is not strictly related to the fruiting pattern, which is a major issue for apple cultivation. Architectural analyses have been developed not only to gain knowledge on the dynamics of tree growth and branching but also to analyse thoroughly the physiological conditions for an optimized fruit-set, fruit quality, and return -bloom. Shoot length and the physiological abortion of young shoots on the same branch (extinction) have shown to be two main components for regular yield and high -quality fruiting. These architectural analyses have also been at the origin of an innovative pruning procedure, artificial spur extinction, developed under the paradigm of precision horticulture. It is implemented in various training systems. The sustainability of intensive apple growing systems is now questioned, especially because of their high dependency on external inputs whether phytosanitary products or fertilizers. Agroforestry, i.e., growing woody perennials and annuals in spatial mixtures and/or temporal sequences, is proposed as a means to reduce such dependencies. It uses plant biodiversity to enhance ecological services including multiple cropping. For apple, the social -economic acceptability and performance of such systems have to be investigated. From the horticultural point of view, this new context challenges the choice of plant material and of training and pruning concepts developed in intensive orchards. From the scientific point of view, apple tree -based agroforestry systems address architectural and physiological issues on how the apple tree can develop and fruit satisfactorily in such biotic and abiotic contexts.

Abstract: Multispecies horticultural systems were traditional in both tropical and temperate regions for millennia, mixing for example fruit trees and vegetables. They have been progressively replaced, especially after World War II, by monocropping horticulture. These specialized systems are highly productive but also need high nutrient and phytosanitary inputs. There is now an increasing interest for biodiversitybased agrosystems with the assumption that increasing plant functional diversity in and around the plot is an efficient lever to reduce these inputs. Indeed, biodiversity is put forward as a way to promote various ecosystem services, including pest regulation and nutrient recycling, and is at the core of agroecology concepts developed a century ago. However, combining agricultural plants grown for production and "companion" plants grown for other services in the same plot needs more study on how the agricultural plant is affected by a generally more competitive context. The focus of our study was the effects of shade, known as a main factor characterizing multispecies systems, especially agroforestry systems, on tree architecture and flowering of a temperate and a tropical species, apple and mango. Overall, our results showed that the effects of the light environment, possibly modified by a diversified agrosystem, has a key role on the architecture and functioning of the agricultural plant, affecting both vegetative and reproductive compartments, and their relationships. This is especially true for fruit trees for which there are carry-over effects across years related to the perennial structural framework. Our study therefore strongly suggests that to strengthen the potential agronomic interest in diversified agrosystems, the holistic view at the core of the system approach needs to be complemented by more knowledge on how the agricultural plant interacts with its biotic environment.

Title: Apple farming systems - current initiatives and some prospective views on how to improve sustainability

Abstract: Apple cultivation has evolved tremendously in past decades. Both apple productivity and aesthetic quality of the fruit have been strongly improved resulting from genetic improvement, optimization of tree training and pruning, and orchard design and management. However, these improvements were also done at the expense of an increasing dependence on external inputs such as water, fertilizers and synthetic pesticides. This dependence is now questioned because of the generated environmental pollutions and health issues. In the last decades, an increasing amount of initiatives have been developed that open the way towards more sustainable apple production systems. Concepts as well as on-station and on-farm works are developed in various contexts such as 'integrated fruit production', 'organic farming' and 'agroecology' with the objectives to increase biological regulations of pests and diseases and/or to improve soil fertility. All together results point out the importance of diversifying resources and habitats for beneficial arthropods in the orchard and its vicinity to foster ecosystem services related to pest suppression and to adopt cultural practices enhancing soil fertility. They also indicate some practical guidelines consisting in a better management of grass alleys and lining hedgerows within and around the orchard, respectively. From a more prospective view and taking inspiration from tropical fruit-tree based agroforestry, these works suggest that combining apple trees with other herbaceous and woody plants with various uses (soft fruit, aromatic plants, etc.) opens to more resilient agroecosystems, possibly mitigating climate change. These works also enlarge our vision of the current apple orchard towards a multiproduction system including apple among other productions. From the 'plant science' point of view the idea to grow apple in agroecosystems challenges current knowledge of the plasticity of the apple tree physiology and architecture, and agronomic performance, in response to interactions with neighbouring plants. It also stimulates necessary collaborations with other research fields such as socio-economics, for example on how the grower may handle those complex agroecosystems, optimize labour and valorize production.

Abstract: Conventional fruit-tree farming systems are highly productive and strongly dependent on external inputs, including pesticides, fertilisers, and water. To reduce this dependence, various initiatives have been developed in past decades, such as Integrated Fruit Production, Organic Farming, and more recently, Agroecology which is strongly inspired by research in ecology. These initiatives include plant diversity as the main driver to improve the sustainability of the orchard. Plant diversity can either be planned (choice of productive and not productive species) or associated (unintentional) and at different scales (within the cultivated plot and/or the surrounding landscape). To increase plant biodiversity, companion, i.e., mostly non-productive, plants can be either herbaceous, bushes, or trees. The interest of plant diversity to improve the sustainability of agrosystems is documented from three points of view: composition, structure, and function. First, companion plants have to fulfil precise functions within the system, such as sustaining nitrogen provisioning (e.g., herbaceous legumes between fruit-tree rows), hosting natural enemies of main pests, or attracting herbivore insects outside the orchard. Recent works on agroecology analyze fruit-tree based agrosystems documenting fruit production and the various "services" (e.g., mitigation of CO2 emission, soil nitrogen availability) companion plants can provide. Second, to optimise plant functioning, it is necessary to define rules of plant assemblage at spatial (e.g., distance between plants) and temporal (e.g., plantation at the same time period or not) levels. Based on a literature survey and current experiments, we will show that agrosystems that combine trees grown for fruit and possibly for timber or firewood and agricultural crops, i.e., fruit-tree based agroforestry systems (FT-AFS), provide promising results in the temperate climate context, including the Mediterranean zones. Further, the introduction of plants providing pest regulation services opens to challenging perspectives toward friendly fruit-tree-based agrosystems.

Abstract: Agroforestry is promoted as a way to improve the sustainability of horticultural systems through plant diversification and also to mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration. It could also alleviate excessive light and temperature in high-radiation regions of the world. However, little is known about the long-term shade adaptation of the temperate fruit tree in agroforestry systems. A study was developed to investigate apple growing under walnut trees in two shade conditions compared to a full light condition. Our aim was to quantify the plasticity of traits and the covariations between traits in these three light conditions using a multiscale approach considering different scales from whole tree to annual shoot and inflorescence. Shade did not affect the height of the apple trees, while it reduced the diameter of the trunk and branches. On the other hand, the total number of growing shoots was reduced in shade, and flowering and fruiting were fewer and more irregular than in full light. Strikingly, at the whole tree scale, covariations between vegetative traits (trunk cross-sectional area versus mean branch cross-sectional area) and between vegetative and reproductive traits (trunk cross-sectional area versus total number of inflorescences) were not altered by shade. However, at the shoot scale, return-bloom was significantly reduced by shade, whereas at the inflorescence scale shade did not affect leaf number or leaf area. We propose a shade adaptation syndrome that includes not only shade intensity but also shade dynamics during the growing season and over consecutive years.

Abstract: Key message Complementarities and/or synergies among different scales of tree architecture enable to achieve different functions simultaneously and/or optimize one function. After trimming, tree reaction occurred in all the scales. Trees are modular organisms within which each scale has attributes enabling them to optimize different functions. Among these functions, space exploration and light interception are strong determinants of tree productivity and survival. By modifying the crown shape, including foliage dispersion in the 3D space and carbon allocation, tree trimming (i.e. the removal of the higher part of the crown) may largely influence how trees fulfill the space exploration and light interception functions. In this study, we used field measurements of tree annual shoots combined with tree reconstruction from Terrestrial Laser Scanning data to analyze how different scales of the tree architecture complement each other to fulfill different functions simultaneously or combine to fulfill one single function more efficiently. We used morphological and functional variables measured at the annual shoot, axis, and tree scales to compare the architectural and functional strategies of two Fraxinus pennsylvanica cultivars and observe how trimming modifies these strategies. Results show that the two cultivars exhibit different strategies. One cultivar tended to optimize the space exploration function at both the annual shoot and axis scales and to optimize the light interception by displaying a large leaf area at the tree scale. The other cultivar tended to optimize light interception efficiency at both axis and tree levels. In both cultivars, trimming improved light interception efficiency and increased investments into space exploration. Nevertheless, after trimming, the two cultivars maintained their main architectural and functional strategy.

Abstract: Climate change associated with a greater variability of inter- and intra-annual droughts and the occurrence of extreme events act in combination to challenge semi-natural and sown productive grasslands in Europe. Successful plant strategies under drought strongly depend on stress intensity. Drought resistance to maintain leaf growth under moderate stress trades off with drought survival after growth cessation under life-threatening drought. Substantial intra-specific variability exists in key forage grasses originating from the Mediterranean to the cool-temperate climates and represents a great potential for adaptation of future ecotypes and cultivars to a larger range of drought intensities. Plant species diversity offers an opportunity to stabilize forage production in two ways. First, growth reduction under stress is significantly smaller for diverse compared to simple plant communities because the former offers the opportunity to include drought-resistant (or drought-surviving) species. Second, positive interactions among species increase ecosystem functioning of more diverse plant communities under moderate drought, allowing them to compensate for drought-induced yield reductions. Currently, available cultivars of perennial forage species adapted to dry climate are still rare and only a few forage species are used in productive systems. Thus, both intra- and inter-specific plant diversity should be better valued to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience of productive grasslands.

Abstract: In response to criticism of current specialized and input-intensive agriculture, diversified farming systems (DFS) have increased in popularity. The most advanced forms of DFS include perennial components (e.g., perennial crops, trees), functionally different plants and livestock, and landscape heterogeneity. These characteristics make it more difficult to assess DFS in agricultural sciences, which have focused to date mainly on low-diversity systems. We provide an overview of the main methodological issues involved in assessing DFS, and their potential solutions. We identify five key methodological challenges for assessing DFS: i) combining conceptual frameworks from different disciplines to develop a holistic view of DFS multi-performance; ii) characterizing DFS structure from a functional perspective to define the relevant spatial extent to assess them; iii) considering DFS ontogeny i.e. the time required for DFS to establish, reach maturity and achieve a dynamic steady state when assessing their performance; iv) aggregating and mapping multiple performance indicators to integrate the range of products and services generated by DFS and to reveal potential synergies and antagonisms; v) defining and characterizing the reference systems used to compare DFS, as systems might differ in history, composition, management, soil-climate, and sociotechnical conditions. These challenges underline the need to overhaul as

Abstract: Irrigated durum wheat is a staple food crop that occupies important areas in Tunisia. However, its performance remains weak, with an average national yield of no more than 3.6 tons ha(-1) and low profitability. Overall, on-farm wheat production will need to increase considerably to meet future demand and ensure minimum profitability for farmers. To this end, this study aims to identify the main levers for improving durum wheat crop performance. For this purpose, we have developed a regional bio-economic model by linking a biophysical model (CROPSYST) with an economic optimization model (MORBIT). CROPSYST was used to establish a database with a view to determining the relationships between farming practices, durum wheat yields, and water productivity within a context of high climate variability. The database was then integrated into a MORBIT model that analyzed the effects of farming practices on durum wheat performance and regional profits. Three scenarios related to irrigation control and the increase in durum wheat prices were developed. The results showed that reconciling irrigation practices with economic policies is the best alternative to improve durum wheat performance and increase profits at a regional level.

Abstract: Farming systems are complex and include a variety of interacting biophysical and technical components. This complexity must be taken into account when designing farming systems to improve sustainability, but more methods are needed to be able to do so. This article seeks to apply the Hierarchical Patch Dynamics theory (HPD) to farming systems to understand farming system complexity and be better able to support farming system re-design. A six-step framework is proposed to adapt the HPD theory to farming system analysis by taking into account (i) spatial and temporal interactions and (ii) field and management diversity. This framework was applied to a vineyard case study. The result was a hierarchical formalization of the farming system. The HPD framework improved understanding and enabled the formalization of (i) the hierarchical structure of the farming system, (ii) the interactions between structure and processes and (iii) scaling up and down from field to farm scale. HPD theory proved to be successful in analyzing farming system complexity at the farm scale. The framework can help with specific aspects of farming system design, such as how to change the scale of study or determining which scale should be used when choosing indicators for crop management and integrating multi-scale constraints and processes.

Abstract: Conversion to organic farming can require deep technical changes that can be implemented through various pathways. This study aimed to better understand and characterize the various pathways that can be followed during conversion to organic farming. Our results highlight four types of trajectories of technical changes that depend on the number and type of technical changes implemented. These trajectories have been associated with four strategies on equipment, labor and vineyard area. Finally, we claim that the study developed herein can support the further understanding of the strategies to be applied for successful agroecological transitions.

Abstract: Grapevine decline, a major global viticulture issue, is defined as a multi-year decrease in vine productivity and/or increase in vine mortality. Although grapevine trunk diseases are one of the most studied causes, the decline is multifactorial and associated with more than 70 factors, including abiotic and biotic hazards. With so many factors to consider, the phenomenon is difficult to understand. Our study aims to make it easier to determine and assess grapevine decline by focusing on three key indicators: yield, mortality and vegetative vigour. We investigated the relationships between these indicators from both a temporal and spatial perspective to propose a set of diagnostic indicators. Thus, we conducted a winegrower survey, a historical analysis of grapevine decline and field measurements of the abovementioned indicators on plot networks in three major French winegrowing regions (see graphical abstract): Bordeaux, Cognac and Languedoc. We found that winegrowers' perceptions of decline were consistent with an objective characterisation based on field measurements of the indicators. Although vine mortality progressively spread over the years, neither the survey nor the historical analysis showed a direct link between decline and yield loss. Rather, large yearly fluctuations in yield, which did not systematically decrease over time, account for this finding. As a result, the mortality rate and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) indicators were shown to be earlier indicators of grapevine decline than yield loss (addressed from the yield achievement ratio, YAR). We performed a multifactorial analysis of the overall data set from the three regions to deepen our understanding of the diversity of declining situations and the underlying environmental and management factors contributing to decline. Finally, two ground-based NDVI indicators and an image-analysis methodology using aerial photographs were proposed as easy-to-obtain indicators of grapevine decline. NDVI indicators were linearly correlated with both the YAR and mortality rate. This study provides a better understanding and promising tools for the early diagnosis of grapevine decline.

Abstract: Since 2006, an increasing number of French vineyards have chosen to convert to organic farming. One major change in vineyard practices includes replacing chemical pesticides with copper and sulfur-based products in line with Council Regulation (EC) No. 834/2007. This change can make overall management and pest and disease control more difficult and potentially lead to yield losses. From 2013 to 2016, a network of 48 vineyard plots, in southern France, under conventional management and in conversion to organic farming were monitored throughout the three-year conversion phase to investigate the grapevine phytosanitary management of four major pests and diseases and variations in control efficiency. The severity of downy and powdery mildew, grape berry moths, and Botrytis bunch rot were assessed and linked to the protection strategy. The findings showed that pests and diseases were controlled in the third year of conversion at similar efficiency levels as in conventional farming. However, the first two years of conversion were a transitional and less successful period during which higher incidences of cryptogamic diseases were observed. This demonstrates a need for winegrowers to receive more in-depth technical advice and support, especially on pest and disease control, during this critical transition period.

Abstract: Yield issues are crucial for winegrowers. In France, yield is often lower than winegrowers' objectives, and there is a need to understand the causes and magnitude of yield variability in vineyard systems. The yield formation process for grapevine (Vitis vinifera) takes place over two consecutive years. Grapevine is also characterised by a limited control of phenology, a winter dormancy period and the existence of storage organs. We adapted the regional agronomic diagnosis approach as defined by Dore et al. (1997) to quantify grapevine yield variability in two complementary case studies. The regional agronomic diagnosis proved useful in acquiring knowledge on grapevine functioning, reflecting on the data collection strategy, and leveraging interventions to better control yield by integrating multiple factors, particularly in the context of transitioning viticulture systems. Furthermore, the successful application of a regional agronomic diagnosis to grapevine crops can be considered as a major contribution to increasing the understanding of yield formation. It helps winegrowers manage yield variability when addressing planned or unplanned changing conditions, such as an agroecological transition or climate change.

Abstract: Given the need to reduce pesticide use and rising consumer demand for healthy food, organic vineyard areas have increased since 2000. Converting to organic farming requires numerous changes in pest and disease management, fertilization and weeding techniques. These changes can lead to difficulties in sustaining yields. Some studies have highlighted higher yields in conventional farming than in organic agriculture, but knowledge on yield dynamics during conversion is lacking. A set of 26 plots, under conventional management and in conversion to organic farming, were monitored from 2013 to 2016 in southern France throughout the three-year conversion phase to investigate the dynamics of grape yield and yield components. The survey showed that the yield and yield components remained similar levels as in conventional farming from the third year of conversion. However, the first two years of conversion were a transitional and less successful period during which yield and yield components decreased. Based on the in-depth analysis of the yield components, we have put forwards hypotheses on the processes at play and technical advice that could support winegrowers as they convert to organic farming.

Organic farming is presented as a way to limit the environmental impact of agriculture and produce healthier food. While studies often compare the performance of organic farming to that of conventional farming, there is a lack of knowledge on the conversion period. The present work explores the dynamics of practices employed during the conversion to organic farming and the impact of this transition on various compartments of the agrosystem. From 2013 to 2016, a regional agronomic diagnosis was performed on a network of 48 vineyard plots * year situations in southern France that are either under conventional management or are transitioning to organic farming. An inventory of practices was performed, and various indicators for the agrosystem status were monitored to investigate the changes that occur during the conversion to organic farming. The results of this study showed that the conversion involves a transitional period during which practices change and are adjusted from year to year. All the compartments of the agrosystem studied are impacted by these changes. Yield reductions observed in the first and second years of conversion could be related to the dynamics of pest and disease severity, decreases in nitrogen status and increases in water stress. Pest and disease control and soil management are key practices that must be mastered to limit the impact of conversion on production. This study shows that knowledge and in-depth support are needed before and during conversion to limit the impact of this transitional period and make the conversion successful.

Abstract: An increasing number of vineyards are converting to organic farming due to concerns about the environmental impacts of agriculture. How difficult this shift is depends on farms' biophysical and economic situations as well as on their specific dynamics. Methods to analyze, assess, and support transition strategies are needed. In this context, the hypothesis can be made that the efficiency-substitution-redesign approach, which is used for describing the level, intensity, and speed of changes made by vineyards, could be used to classify transition strategies. On-farm interviews and surveys were conducted at vineyards in conversion to organic farming in two French winegrowing regions: Languedoc and Bordeaux. The agronomic changes made to various grape production technical operations during the conversion period were described and assessed by using the efficiency-substitution-redesign approach. Potential economic consequences of conversion were measured by looking at farms' accounting records. Considering the high number of variables taken into account in the detailed analysis of each operation for the conversion to organic farming, the efficiency-substitution-redesign approach was successfully used to classify transition strategies according to the type of changes made. The results showed that change intensity varied between farms with no clear correlation between the type of changes and economic consequences. Farm trajectories were then correlated to the speed and intensity of changes with quantitative transition indicators. Here, a quantitative application of the efficiency-substitution-redesign approach was used for the first time to assess and classify organic farming conversion strategies according to a scale of change intensity and speed of changes. These results are essential to enhance understanding of what happens during conversion to organic farming and to better support winegrowers' trajectories.

Abstract: Understanding the processes driving plant phenology is crucial for assessing how shifts in climate affect plant productivity and species' distribution. Despite the key role of fine roots in carbon and nutrient cycling, root phenology is less well characterized than shoot phenology, due largely to methodological problems when measuring root systems at depths > 1.0 m. Fine root demography is also poorly related to the better established patterns of aboveground primary and secondary growth. We examined the influence of climatic factors on the dynamics of fine root elongation rate (RER), to a depth of 4.7 m, and assessed relationships with shoot phenology of walnut trees (Juglans nigra x J. regia) in a Mediterranean agroforestry system. Rhizotrons and minirhizotrons were installed for 21 months to monitor RER. Dendrometers were used to measure trunk and lateral root radial growth during the same period. Results showed that RER was not synchronous with budbreak and leaf unfolding (occurring from April to May) at any soil depth. However, during phase 2 of the growing season (June-November), daily RER in the upper soil (0.00-1.70 m) was synchronous with both trunk and lateral root radial growth, which were themselves positively correlated with the mean monthly soil and air temperatures and the mean monthly solar irradiance. Mean daily RER was not correlated to mean monthly soil and air temperatures at any soil depth during phase 2 of the growing season. However, during this period, mean daily RER of very shallow roots (0.00-0.85 m) was significantly and positively correlated with both mean monthly soil water content and solar irradiance. Maximal daily RER occurred during phase 2 of the growing season for the three upper soil layers (June-October), but peaked during the aerial dormant season (December) in the deepest soil layer (4.00-4.70 m). We conclude that drivers of phenology for different tree organs and between shallow and deep roots are not the same. This spatial plasticity in growth throughout a tree enables it to maximize resource uptake, even throughout the winter months, and thus is a highly useful mechanism for increasing tree resistance to abiotic stresses.

Abstract: Rainfed Mediterranean agriculture (MA) must adapt to water scarcity due to climate change and pressures on water resources. According to recent literature, two adaptation solutions based on the concept of diversification can be explored. The first solution is crop diversification at the field level. Three main cropping systems, namely agroforestry, intercropping, and service crops, have been shown to increase soil water availability and to improve crop water use. The second solution is to consider diversification at the landscape level by diversifying crops and associated agricultural management practices (in number, abundance, and spatial organization) and building small-scale water-harvesting infrastructures (WHI). In order to move toward a sustainable MA, one of the main scientific challenges ahead is to provide knowledge and tools, such as integrated agro-hydrological models, useful to evaluate several spatiotemporal combinations of these solutions in order to optimize soil water availability and crop water use.

Abstract: Understanding the effects of the huge diversity of cropping systems on local biodiversity is challenging but necessary to implement agroecological systems. Through a functional approach, the translation of cropping systems into resource and disturbance gradients is a promising way to decipher the relationship between cropping systems and biodiversity but has never been implemented for arthropods. To investigate the contributions of resource and disturbance gradients arising from cropping systems vs environmental context (regional effect, meteorological conditions and landscape characteristics) on beneficial arthropod communities, we used a dataset collected in 60 crop fields from three French areas over a 5-year period. It includes all farmer interventions, crop sequences, meteorological data, landscape composition and carabid samplings. We found that environmental context contributed to about 75% of explained carabid variations on average, while resource and disturbance gradients contributed to about 25% of explained carabid variations. The resource and disturbance gradients were particularly important in winter and in the spring preceding the spring-summer period to determine carabid variations. Moreover, we identified thresholds above which resource and disturbance gradients start being beneficial or detrimental for carabids. For example, increased treatment index in spring decreased the total activity density of carabids during the spring-summer period. Synthesis and applications. While implementing for the first time a functional approach to understand the effects of different facets of cropping systems on arthropods, our study also allows us to identify periods and thresholds above which specific practices affect carabids. Finally, avoiding bare soils all along the year, keeping pesticide use intensity below the identified thresholds and adopting a wide diversity of tillage strategies at the landscape scale should all contribute to enhance in-field carabid occurrences and richness.

Abstract: There is a crucial need for tools to help researchers, technicians and farmers designing sustainable agroecosystems based on agroecology Indeed, such agroecosystems are inherently complex and their design requires to integrate various data and unstabilised scientific knowledge. In this paper, we consider the issue of selecting service plant species according to their potential to provide ecosystem services. To tackle that issue, we adopt an approach based both on a formalized representation of domain knowledge, which enables reasoning, and on the exploitation of available data, collected independently of the targeted application. More specifically, we rely on the one hand on recent scientific results in agronomy linking functional traits (i.e., measurable characteristics of plant species) to ecosystem services, and on the other hand on data about functional traits collected by the research community in ecology. The architecture of our system is inspired by the ontologybased data access paradigm, which allows to combine data and knowledge in a principled way. We provide a methodology to acquire scientific knowledge in the form of diagrams linked to data sources, as well as a formalization in a logical rule -based language. Importantly, our rules are independent from specific diagrams and data, to ensure genericity and facilitate the evolution of the system. We detail the construction of a knowledge base devoted to vine grassing, i.e., installing herbaceous service plants in vineyards, and present an evaluation of the system's results on this use case. We finally discuss the lessons learned and further challenges to be met.

Abstract: The ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data to detect the main wheat phenological phases was investigated in the Bekaa plain of Lebanon. Accordingly, the temporal variation of Sentinel-1 (S1) signal was analyzed as a function of the phenological phases' dates observed in situ (germination; heading and soft dough), and harvesting. Results showed that S1 data, unlike the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, were able to estimate the dates of theses phenological phases due to significant variations in S1 temporal series at the dates of germination, heading, soft dough, and harvesting. Particularly, the ratio VV/VH at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees) was able to detect the germination and harvesting dates. VV polarization at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees) was able to detect the heading phase, while VH polarization at high incidence angle (43-45 degrees) was better than that at low incidence angle (32-34 degrees), in detecting the soft dough phase. An automated approach for main wheat phenological phases' determination was then developed on the western part of the Bekaa plain. This approach modelled the S1 SAR temporal series by smoothing and fitting the temporal series with Gaussian functions (up to three Gaussians) allowing thus to automatically detect the main wheat phenological phases from the sum of these Gaussians. To test its robustness, the automated method was applied on the northern part of the Bekaa plain, in which winter wheat is harvested usually earlier because of the different weather conditions. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the estimation of the phenological phases' dates was 2.9 days for germination, 5.5 days for heading, 5.1 days soft dough, 3.0 days for West Bekaa's harvesting, and 4.5 days for North Bekaa's harvesting. In addition, a slight underestimation was observed for germination and heading of West Bekaa (-0.2 and -1.1 days, respectively) while an overestimation was observed for soft dough of West Bekaa and harvesting for both West and North Bekaa (3.1, 0.6, and 3.6 days, respectively). These results are encouraging, and thus prove that S1 data are powerful as a tool for crop monitoring, to serve enhanced crop management and production handling.

Abstract: The promotion of optimum rotations and agricultural management of winter wheat-based cropping systems is very critical, as wheat is considered an essential component in the Mediterranean diet. Considering the delicate economic situation of farmers in the Mediterranean area, recommending a low risk, sustainable farming system is desirable. In this study, an innovative application of a multi-criteria field-level approach is presented, targeting food security, farmer profitability and environmental sustainability. The CropSyst biophysical simulation model was calibrated and implemented for the study site. It was chosen for its agro-environmental robustness to simulate four rotations (wheat-wheat, wheat-fallow, wheat-potato, and wheat-fava bean). Four types of wheat agricultural management systems (full fertilization and full irrigation, full fertilization and zero irrigation, zero fertilization and full irrigation, and zero fertilization and irrigation) were tested in low and high soil water holding capacity (WHC) types. The effects of soil conditions, management practices and rotation type on wheat grain yields were assessed. Furthermore, the performance of each winter wheat-based cropping system was evaluated in terms of productivity (protein production and profitability) and the efficient use of resources (nitrogen and water), as well as the economic risk of low relative productivity each one engenders. The results show that there is no particular optimal scenario that can simultaneously ensure high productivity, reduce economic risk of low relative productivity, and achieve high wheat- water- and nitrogen-use efficiency. However, the wheat-fava bean rotation cultivated with no wheat fertilization appeared to be a better substitute to the wheatwheat rotation in terms of protein production (0.93 t/ha versus 0.8 t/ha in low WHC soil and 1.34 t/ha versus 1.17 t/ha in high WHC). This cropping system achieved a higher net profit (2111 US$/ha versus 1222US$/ha in low WHC and 3550 US$/ha versus 2450 US$/ha in high WHC), showing high resource-use efficiency and was less risky for farmers. Moreover, a very high profit could only be attained with the wheat-potato rotation (8640 US$/ha and 12,170 US$/ha in low and high WHC, respectively), yet with low input-efficiency and high economic risk of low relative productivity.

Abstract: The diversity of both pedoclimatic and socio-economic contexts in agricultural landscapes makes evaluating the impacts of climate change a challenge. Models are pertinent tools to quantitatively explore possible futures, and participatory approaches help account for local diversity. We developed a model through an approach that involves stakeholders in the model's construction and testing and in the discussion of results. We simulated spatially explicit impacts of climate change on water balance, grape phenology, and yield in a Mediterranean vineyard watershed for two climate scenarios. Results show a decrease in grape production of 7-14% by 2100. Yield decrease would be higher in irrigated high-yield areas despite a doubling of irrigation water supply. A forecasted 6 degrees C increase in temperature during berry ripening would threaten wine quality. The approach allows the communication of model results and limitations to stakeholders. It is a promising means of identifying potential local adaptations to climate change.

Abstract: In many areas of the world, maintaining grapevine production will require adaptation to climate change. While rigorous evaluations of adaptation strategies provide decision makers with valuable insights, those that are published often overlook major constraints, ignore local adaptive capacity, and suffer from a compartmentalization of disciplines and scales. The objective of our study was to identify current knowledge of evaluation methods and their limitations, reported in the literature. We reviewed 111 papers that evaluate adaptation strategies in the main vineyards worldwide. Evaluation approaches are analyzed through key features (e.g., climate data sources, methodology, evaluation criteria) to discuss their ability to address climate change issues, and to identify promising outcomes for climate change adaptations. We highlight the fact that combining adaptation levers in the short and long term (location, vine training, irrigation, soil, and canopy management, etc.) enables local compromises to be reached between future water availability and grapevine productivity. The main findings of the paper are three-fold: (1) the evaluation of a combination of adaptation strategies provides better solutions for adapting to climate change; (2) multi-scale studies allow local constraints and opportunities to be considered; and (3) only a small number of studies have developed multi-scale and multi-lever approaches to quantify feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation. In addition, we found that climate data sources were not systematically clearly presented, and that climate uncertainty was hardly accounted for. Moreover, only a small number of studies have assessed the economic impacts of adaptation, especially at farm scale. We conclude that the development of methodologies to evaluate adaptation strategies, considering both complementary adaptations and scales, is essential if relevant information is to be provided to the decision-makers of the wine industry.

Abstract: Context: Climate change threatens wine growing systems in varying ways because of their high diversity, even at a local scale. This diversity needs to be considered when designing and assessing adaptation strategies to co-ordinate better with these diverse local conditions.Objective: We developed a participatory modeling approach to (1) design adaptation strategies in a viticultural watershed in southern France, (2) numerically and spatially evaluate their effects under future climatic condi-tions, and (3) discuss the results with stakeholders.Methods: We organized two sets of collective workshops, before and after a simulation phase. During the workshops, we designed four adaptation strategies that correspond to different ways to combine adaptation measures proposed by stakeholders. A spatially explicit model was used to evaluate the effects of six adaptation measures (late varieties, irrigation, reducing canopy size, adjusting cover cropping, reducing density, and shading) at field scale and combinations of them at watershed scale. Simulations were realized under a high emissions climate change scenario RCP 8.5. Model-based evaluations were followed by discussions with stake-holders. The cost-effectiveness of adaptation strategies was estimated at farm scale using an indicator designed by the stakeholders. Results and conclusions: The spatial combination of adaptation measures in a viticultural watershed provided options for adapting wine growing systems to climate change. A delayed harvest strategy with currently available late varieties provided only minimal relief from high temperature during ripening. A water stress limitation strategy would compensate for production losses if disruptive adaptations (e.g., reduced density) were adopted and if more vineyards were irrigated. A relocation strategy would encourage premium wine production in the constrained mountainous areas, where grapevines systems are historically adapted to limited water conditions. A soil improvement strategy was mentioned but not evaluated in the model due to scarce data and literature on the possible improvement of soil water holding capacity.Significance: The sharing of knowledge between researchers, technical experts, and wine growers enabled the construction of a common understanding of the local impacts and adaptation potential to climate change in the watershed. In further research, this knowledge could help decision makers to define pathways for adaptive ac-tions at farm scale.

Abstract: In accordance with European Directive 2009/128/CE, France has set up national policies to curb the reliance of agriculture on phytosanitary inputs. The DEPHY network is one such initiative;, which has been designed to drive, support and document the fieldwork of 3,000 farms voluntarily taking part in a collective input reduction programme. This study aimed to describe the achievements of the network's viticultural sector, as its perennial crop is heavily reliant on pesticide applications. We chose a sample of 343 wine-growing systems across mainland France, analysed records of their vineyard operations from before they joined the network, and compared them to those from the 2017-2020 period. We used the Treatment Frequency Index (TFI) to assess pesticide reliance together with other techno-economical parameters: production costs, workloads, greenhouse gas emissions and disease control. A significant decrease in pesticide use was found over the whole study period, with, for instance, an average TFI reduction of 24 %, which is consistent with national objectives but unmatched outside of the network. We observed an overall shift towards pesticide inputs with lower repercussions on health or the environment, as well as different TFI reduction trajectories based on initial pesticide dependency. We described the alternative practices introduced to the systems, and our results suggest that reductions in pesticide use stem from quite small and minor changes made to the cropping systems. These new practices only slightly lowered the vineyards' technical and economical performances in specific situations involving an indepth revamping of the systems; e.g., conversion to organic viticulture. To increase pesticide phase-out, further research is needed on redesigning cropping systems, and on how to scale up the network's results to the national level.

Abstract: This study aimed to characterize the occurrence, duration, and intensity of the flushes of vegetative growth in two peach cultivars of Prunus persica L. Batsch, grown as a pioneer endeavor at a high-altitude tropical climate site in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The observational experiment was carried out in 2017/18 and 2018/19 on the 'Tropic Beauty' and 'BRS Kampai' cultivars by an evaluation of the number and duration of flushes of vegetative growth during the year over two cycles. The number of fruit-bearing shoots, total number of leaves and shoot length were also assessed. At harvest, fruit load and diameter were determined and grouped into diameter ranges. The number of hours recorded at different temperature ranges, < 10.0 degrees C; 10.1-15.0 degrees C; 15.1-20.0 degrees C; 20.1-25.0 degrees C; > 25.1 degrees C, were summed separately and divided into daily and nightly periods. The peach tree has an unusual vegetative growth pattern when cultivated in a tropical area, which occurs in two flushes, with the first flush occurring from budbreak to fruit harvest between June and Sept, forming short shoots (less than 10 cm), with early shoot growth cessation, with a limited leaf number that can potentially diminish the supply of carbohydrates to the fruit, leading to smaller growth. The second flush occurs after harvest, between Oct and Dec, when there is an increase in daily temperature and precipitation, and no competition with fruits. Notabily, these second flush shoots grow with greater vigor and regularization of the growth cycle, forming fruit-bearing shoots with abundant leaf and flower buds for the next production cycle.

Abstract: This study aimed to determine how within-plot soil heterogeneity combined with yearly climate variability can promote the heterogeneity of vine growth at plot level, and which soil-climate parameters influence final yield and berry composition the most. An 8-year experiment was conducted on grapevine in two zones of a vineyard (1 ha) differentiated according to grapevine vigour as determined by NDVI: high vigour (HV) and low vigour (LV). The heterogeneity of the soil properties (depth, texture and composition), plant growth (shoots and roots) and plant production (yield components and berry composition) were determined at plot level. Compared to the LV zone, the HV zone was associated with deeper soils, higher soil water and nitrogen availability, CEC and montmorillonite/illite ratio. More extended root systems, higher vegetative growth and higher yield were observed in the HV zone compared to the LV zone. Drier and warmer vintages increased the difference in heterogeneity of vine growth and yield between the two zones. Berry composition (primary and secondary metabolites) also differed between HV and LV zones but seemed unconnected to vigour and mainly depended on soil-climate-plant interactions over the years. The heterogeneity of plant vigour within the vineyard mainly resulted from differences in root exploration, soil profile and composition (notably montmorillonite/illite ratio). The present study identified soil and crop factors that, depending on weather conditions, can be drivers for reducing the heterogeneity of plant development and improving productivity at vineyard level.

Abstract: The spatial variability of vineyards can be characterised through precision viticulture that will allow setting the boundaries of homogeneous management zones. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of soil and plant management (site-specific management) to increase yields and improve berry quality. During three consecutive seasons, contrasting treatments designed ad hoc for two zones of vigour pre-established by NDVI were tested: high vigour zone (HV) and low vigour zone (LV). The treatments were aimed at reducing water and nitrogen supply and improving microclimatic conditions in the cluster zone in the HV zone. In the LV zone, treatments were aimed at increasing water and nitrogen supply. Leaf removal in the HV zone was the most efficient treatment to improve productivity and quality. Moreover, the water restriction improved grape quality, especially in a rainy year. The regulated deficit irrigation strategy applied in the LV zone at specific phenological stages was shown to increase vegetative growth, yield and to improve grape anthocyanins and phenols contents. The benefits of additional nitrogen supply in the LV zone on plant nitrogen status, yield, and berry composition were highly dependent on water availability. Ultimately, this study provided new insights into the relationship between water and nitrogen availability and how this determines vigour and influences yield and grape quality and influences the deviation from a "Productive Target" pattern. The use of site-specific techniques could be adjusted on a small production scale, thanks to mapping carried out with precision viticulture technologies.

Abstract: Viticulture involves high pesticide use. While methods to reduce this use have been proposed by researchers, they have not yet been widely implemented by winegrowers. Involving winegrowers in the participatory design of new management strategies could encourage the adoption of these methods to reduce pesticide use. In this study, we designed and tested a participatory approach to reducing pesticide use that would be acceptable to winegrowers from a South -Western cooperative (i.e., not 'pioneering' winegrowers). The approach was composed of three main steps: A) co -design of the management strategies, B) implementation of the management strategies, and C) co -evaluation of the performances of the implemented management strategies. Winegrowers, researchers, advisors and engineers were involved in the study. The application of this participatory approach enabled the co -design and testing of two management strategies: IPM for Integrated Pest Management [50% reduction of pesticide treatment frequency index (TFI) as compared to the French High Environmental Value reference (HEV)], and ORG2kgCo for organic farming system with a maximum of 2 kg of copper/ha/year. These two management strategies were implemented by 11 winegrowers in three vineyards in SouthWestern France. In both management strategies, two main technical levers were selected to reduce pesticide use: a Decision Support System to optimise the use and substitution of pesticides by biocontrol products. The implementation of the IPM management strategy resulted in a significant reduction of TFI (from -14% to -57%, with an average of -25%, for all pesticides combined) compared to HEV, and the winegrowers who tested ORG2kgCo managed to not exceed the limit of 2 kg of copper per year. This original participatory approach, combining co -design workshops, on -farm experimentation and co -evaluation workshops, highlighted the benefits of involving winegrowers in the reduction of pesticide use.

Abstract: Key message This study contributed to the understanding of acrotony in apple cultivars in a mild winter region, contrasting high- and low-chilling requirement apple cultivars, and the role of this behavior in plant adaptability. When there is insufficient chilling accumulation during the cold season, apple trees present erratic and poor budbreak. However, there is a lack of information regarding carbohydrate metabolism and their influence on budbreak and branch architecture in apples grown in subtropical humid climates. This work aimed to evaluate budbreak and the availability of carbohydrates in distal and proximal portions of 1-year-old apple tree shoots, and to verify their relationships with axillary shoot formation in spring. Two apple cultivars 'Eva' and 'Fuji', with low and high chilling requirements, respectively, were assessed in a mild winter region of Brazil. From April to October of 2012, 2013 and 2014, 25 one-year-old shoots of each cultivar were sampled bi-weekly. These shoots were divided into distal and proximal portions. Wood from five shoots was sampled to quantify the nonstructural carbohydrate and alpha-amylase content for each portion. The single-node cutting test was used to observe mean time to budburst for the remaining 20 shoots. In generally, our results suggest that under mild winter conditions, the apple tree does not enter into deep endodormancy. Furthermore, there were biological and biochemical differences between the distal and proximal portions of the bearing-shoots for all the studied variables, likely related to the higher sink force in the distal portion. Consequently, the buds from the distal portion sprout first, thereby establishing a primigenic dominance over the buds of the proximal portion. Our study also suggests that the shallow endodormancy of high chilling requirement cultivars cultivated in mild winter regions would make paradormancy predominant, emphasizing acrotonic branching in these cultivars. There was greater availability of nonstructural carbohydrates and alpha-amylase activity in the wood of the distal portion of 1-year-bearing shoots of apple trees under mild winter conditions, regardless of the cultivar.

Abstract: The evidence that most agricultural landscapes are failing to deliver on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision suggests that future landscapes will need to be more explicitly designed. Although recent research has produced a number of ecological and social principles that should form the basis of agricultural landscape design process, implementation is still in its infancy. One difficulty is the context-dependency of ecological responses and the resulting limiting capacity to predict the benefits of landscape transformation for the targeted organisms or services. In addition, there is a poor understanding of the obstacles to and levers for the implementation of collective management at the landscape scale. In this paper, we argue that Landscape Monitoring Networks (LMN), i.e. long-term and standardized monitoring of ecological and managerial processes within a set of replicated regional landscapes, can contribute to tackling these issues. We first present the current challenges in designing agroecological landscapes before outlining the principles of LMN and how these research facilities could help deliver ecological and social understanding along a gradient from place-based to generic knowledge. We then discuss critical issues that need to be solved to ensure that LMN delivers relevant knowledge for landscape design. We illustrate this through the experience of an ongoing LMN that was created in France in 2014 to address biodiversity and pest control services in agricultural landscapes.

Abstract: PREMISE The expression of shade adaptation traits is expected to be stronger in low light and can be detrimental to flowering and yield. Our study focused on the expression of shade adaptation traits of apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh. 'Dalinette') in an agroforestry system. METHODS The architecture of 45 apple trees in their third and fourth year was extensively described and analyzed at the tree scale and compared depending on the light quantity received during the growing season. Flower cluster phenology and the relation between leaf area and floral initiation were also investigated. RESULTS The number of growing shoots and the leaf area were reduced by shade even if specific leaf area increased with increasing shade. Shade did not modify primary growth but did decrease secondary growth, so that apple tree shoots in shade were slender, with a lower taper and reduced number and proportion of flower clusters. The correlation between floral initiation and leaf area was high both in full and moderate light but not for apple trees in low light. Shade did not impact the date of bud burst and the early phenological stages of flower clusters, but it reduced the number of days at full bloom. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that while the architecture of apple trees is modified by a reduction in light intensity, it is not until a reduction of 65% that the capability to produce fruit is impeded. These results could help optimize the design of apple-tree-based agroforestry systems.

Abstract: Apple cultivation has evolved tremendously in the past decades to increase tree productivity and fruit quality. However, this was achieved at the cost of an increasing dependence on external inputs such as water, fertilizers and pesticides. This dependence is now questioned because of the generated environmental pollution and health issues. Different solutions have been considered to reduce this dependence including more efficient practices that improve resilience of agricultural systems to external pressures (climatic disturbances, new diseases, economic crises). To reduce pest and disease pressure, to improve resources use and to buffer extreme climatic events, agroforestry systems (AFS), i.e., the association, in one field, of tailored perennial and annual crops and possibly animals, are proposed as a way to use positive interactions between various plants. In temperate climate, AFS associate a tree stratum and a (or several) crop stratum, e.g., fruit trees and vegetables. An original AFS located in southeastern France, characterized by a Mediterranean climate and composed of mature walnut grown for timber, apple trees in an intermediate vertical stratum, and alfalfa at the lowest stratum, is being used to study the impact of an AFS on apple trees. Comparing apple trees in the AFS and in full sun, we first showed a significant effect of walnuts on the below-canopy microclimate reducing incoming global radiation and acting as a buffer on temperatures surrounding the apple trees. Secondly, AFS significantly altered the apple tree stem geometry (lesser tapering), growth dynamics (more growth cessation) and morphology (higher individual leaf area and specific leaf area). Results will be discussed with regard to the putative long-term effects of agroforestry conditions on the apple tree architecture and fruiting.

Abstract: In response to the sustainability issues that agriculture faces in advanced economies, agroecology has gained increasing relevance in scientific, political, and social debates. This has promoted discussion about transitions to agroecology, which represents a significant advancement. Accordingly, it has become a growing field of research. We reviewed the literature on and in support of farm transitions to agroecology in advanced economies in order to identify key research challenges and suggest innovative research paths. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Research that supports exploration and definition of desired futures, whether based on future-oriented modeling or expert-based foresight approaches, should more explicitly include the farm level. It should stimulate the creativity and design ability of farmers and other stakeholders, and also address issues of representation and power among them. (2) Research that creates awareness and assesses farms before, during or after transition requires more holistic and dynamic assessment frameworks. These frameworks need to be more flexible to adapt to the diversity of global and local challenges. Their assessment should explicitly include uncertainty due to the feedback loops and emergent properties of transitions. (3) Research that analyzes and supports farms during transition should focus more on the dynamics of change processes by valuing what happens on the farms. Research should especially give more credence to on-farm experiments conducted by farmers and develop new tools and methods (e.g., for strategic monitoring) to support these transitions. This is the first review of scientific studies of farm transitions to agroecology. Overall, the review indicates that these transitions challenge the system boundaries, temporal horizons, and sustainability dimensions that agricultural researchers usually consider. In this context, farm transitions to agroecology require changes in the current organization and funding of research in order to encourage longer term and more adaptive configurations.

Abstract: Purpose Consumer demand and state incentives in certain EU countries are driving the rapid development of organic viticulture. However, compared with conventional viticulture, it has shown higher interannual variability in its environmental impacts. Improved understanding of this variability would help organic winegrowers better address their environmental impacts. Methods This two-part study examined interannual variability of environmental impacts of four vineyards with contrasting pedoclimatic and technical production conditions. First, life cycle assessments were performed on each of these four vineyards for two contrasted years in terms of both climate and pest and disease pressure. Next, for one of these vineyards located in Mediterranean conditions, life cycle assessments were completed on a chronosequence of six consecutive years. Life cycle assessments of organic wine grapes were calculated based on detailed inventories of data from the eight real vineyard situations. Interannual variations were considered to be the deviation between the impact results of two production years. Results and discussion In all the vineyards, diesel combustion was the main impact contributor. For the four vineyards, the impacts that varied most were generally freshwater ecotoxicity, soil ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, freshwater eutrophication and metal depletion. The intensity/range of interannual variations differed between plots. The main agricultural operations contributing to impact variations were from disease management of climate-related disease pressures. The 6-year chronosequence analysis showed that certain years were very similar in terms of impact results. The impact that varied most was surprisingly terrestrial acidification. The chronosequence analysis brought to light that the choice of active ingredient could be a greater source of impact variations than interannual climatic conditions and disease pressure. Conclusions This study provides an overview of the hotspots and variability of organic viticulture environmental impacts in contrasted climate years and a climatic chronosequence. The main pathways for environmental performance improvements are (i) reducing fuel consumption by either limiting the number of operations, using more fuel-efficient machines or different energy sources or/and adjusting tractor speed; (ii) reducing the doses and emissions of copper products and choosing the less impacting types of copper; and (iii) limiting nitrogen and heavy metal emissions through the choice of fertiliser type and management.

Abstract: Background: Viticulture is very demanding in inputs. Organic viticulture is often seen as a sustainable system but has also environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is able to discriminate vineyard managements. Aims: Our study explores the interest of LCA to assess, compare and improve organic vineyard management routes through a comparison of information given by practices inventories, Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs) and LCA. LCA methodological challenges are also discussed. Material and methods: Eight cases were studied in three French wine regions and two years. LCI and Life Cycle Impact Assessments (LCIAs) were calculated, five impacts were selected by correlation (climate change, fresh water eutrophication, terrestrial ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification, marine eutrophication). Results and discussion: Practices and quantity of inputs were contrasted among the cases. The study of impacts on climate change revealed the hierarchy of importance of operations and a different ranking of cases for the functional units Ha and Kg. The LCIAs showed major differences between cases for some impacts and their drivers. LCIA and LCI permitted to account for the life cycle dimension of the impacts and for the toxicity and persistence of pesticides. The challenges of organic vineyard LCA are to (i) better consider sulphur and copper, (ii) enrich databases on organic fertilizer, and (iii) build an LCA indicator of biodiversity impact. Conclusion: LCA is better than practices inventories and LCI to assess organic viticulture.

Abstract: Introduction: Climate change (CC) and the increased occurrence of extreme climatic events pose a serious threat to crop yields and their stability worldwide. This study analyzed the CC mitigation potential of an alley cropping system on crop physiological stresses and growth as compared to a monoculture system. Materials and Methods: Growth of winter durum wheat, cultivated alone (agriculture) and in combination with hybrid walnut (agroforestry), was simulated with the Hi-sAFe agroforestry model, as driven by business-as-usual Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections, split into three scenarios, representing Past (1951-1990), Present (1991-2030), and Future (2031-2070) climatic conditions. Crop growth and the occurrence of thermal, nitrogen, and water stresses were analyzed. Results: Cold-related stresses were modest in Past and almost disappeared over time. Heat, drought, and nitrogen stresses increased about twofold from Past to Future, but were reduced by 20-35% in agroforestry, already with medium-sized trees (diameter at breast height (DBH) of about 10-15 cm). Crop yields in agriculture increased from Past to the end of Present and then remained stable. This moderately decreased with tree age in agroforestry (especially in Future). Discussion: The impact of CC on the crop was buffered in agroforestry, especially for the most extreme climatic events. The mitigation of crop microclimate and the increased stability of crop yields highlight the potential of agroforestry as a CC adaptation strategy.

Abstract: Crop diversification and agroecological practices preserving biodiversity are a way to foster ecosystem services. The ALTO project is a multi-actor research project based on new fruit production concepts. Three diversified orchards in three sites of Southern France were designed following the same objectives of ecological intensification and production in very low or pesticide-free systems. Agronomic, ecological and organizational aspects were involved in the co-design approach. The first system is a newly planted circular orchard with a pest suppressive design. The second is an orchard, with previous agroecological infrastructures and fruit trees, that has evolved " step by step" into a diversified production area. The third site investigates the effects of spatial arrangement of an agroforestry apple agrosystem on tree architecture and functioning. The design and the evaluation of these experimental systems address three main questions, shared by one, two or all sites: 1) Can crop and non-crop diversification, as well as spatial arrangement, limit fruit damage caused by pests? 2) Can crop design, more specifically agroforestry, impacts abiotic resource sharing between crops? 3) How growing fruit-trees in these diversified systems impact workload and organization? Although this research is in progress and requires multiyear data, the first results provide feedback on the effectiveness of pest suppressive strategies (trap plants and low-susceptibility cultivars, barrier effects, flower strips and diversified surrounding landscape to favor natural enemies of pests, etc.), as well as on resource sharing for light, and on flowering. Tradeoffs between agronomic, ecological and organizational aspects are also investigated. Besides, the experimental prototypes are likely to evolve with time integrating further exchanges with stakeholders and lessons from on-going management. Multicriteria evaluation of these experimented multi-production prototypes is still in progress but the present analysis opens avenues for agroecological design in perennial crops.

Abstract: Weeds are a major threat in tropical regions where climate conditions favor their growth and development. This is particularly true in low-input rice-based cropping systems in the Malagasy highlands, where weed management is mainly done by manual removal. Crop rotation is often promoted as an efficient way to control weed infestations, while the role of fertilization is more controversial. In this study, we compared rice monoculture to three rainfed rice-based two-year rotations: rice followed by groundnut, rice followed by sorghum-cowpea mixture, and rice followed by a velvet-bean crotalaria mixture. Each rotation was tested with two levels of fertilization (5 t DM ha(-1) organic manure, sole or in combination with mineral fertilizer - 400 kg ha(-1) NPK + 200 kg ha(-1) urea). We assessed the effect of rotation and fertilization on weed composition, diversity, biomass and rice yield. Additionally, the farmers' perception of weed harmfulness and the relation between their assessment of weed harmfulness and rice production was tested. Our results showed that weed biomass significantly decreased rice yield but only under the low fertilization level. The rotation of rice with the velvet beancrotalaria mixture was efficient in reducing weed biomass, modified weed community composition and allowed to achieve the highest rice yield. A significant negative relationship was found between weed community harmfulness index and weed species richness. Yet, the lowest rice yield was observed under rice monoculture despite a higher species richness over years and under high fertilization level. The lack of significant correlation between the harmfulness index and the actual rice yield is probably because our index is partly based on farmer's perception, and only on major weeds. More studies on tropical weed harmfulness are needed to support the design of ecologically intensified cropping systems.

Abstract: This work is devoted to precision agriculture and more precisely to the spatial monitoring of water status in viticulture. An empirical approach was introduced in 2008 based on the extrapolation across a domain (vineyard block, vineyard, region) of vine water status observations from a reference site using a simple statistical model, called SPIDER, and proved efficient in many studies. Once the extrapolation model is calibrated, this approach leads to a concentration of measurements for one site only (reference site) while providing an estimate of the grapevine water status at a larger spatial scale. It is a promising hybrid approach based both on regular (but targeted) measurements and on modelling. However, so far only empirical guidelines for its practical use have been provided. Moreover, the limits of validity (spatial, temporal, etc.) of such an approach are not known. This work intends to use a mechanistic model based on grapevine water balance modelling to study to what extent a simulated water status can be spatially extrapolated at the field scale. The water balance model was calibrated on two datasets (different cultivars and weather data) and used to analyse the performances of SPIDER. The results confirmed the relevance of the empirical approach (SPIDER) based on water status spatial extrapolation with a low error level on the two datasets studied. The use of the water balance model also helped define the validity domain of SPIDER: it confirmed the importance of having dominantly dry conditions and revealed the possibility of recovering good prediction quality after strong rainfall or irrigation. This study globally demonstrates the relevance of spatial extrapolation of the vine water status from a reference site with a linear regression model and provides new insights on the properties of the predictions for application in viticulture either at the within-field level or at larger scale.

Abstract: Agroecosystems are facing new challenges in the context of a growing and increasingly interconnected human population, and a paradigm shift is needed to successfully address the many complex questions that these challenges will generate. The transition to providing multiple services within an agroecosystem is a starting point for heightened multifunctionality, however, there is still hesitation among stakeholders about moving towards multi-service systems, largely because of the lack of knowledge linking productivity and multifunctionality. We reason that much of this reticence could be overcome through a better understanding of stakeholder re-quirements and innovative transdisciplinary research extended in the dimensions of time and space. We assembled experts in France to identify priority research questions for co-constructing projects with stakeholders. We identified 18 key questions, as well as the obstacles that hinder their resolution and propose potential so-lutions for tackling these obstacles. We illustrate that research into agroecosystem multifunctionality and service production must be a hugely collaborative effort and needs to integrate knowledge from different sectors and communities. Promoting dialogue, standardization and data-sharing would enhance transdisciplinary progress. Biodiversity is highlighted as a key factor to explore and incorporate into modelling approaches, but major advances must be made in the understanding of dynamic changes in the biodiversity-function-service nexus across landscapes. Resolving these research questions will allow us to translate knowledge into decision objec-tives, identify adaptation and tipping points in agroecosystems and develop social-ecological economic pathways that are adaptive over time.

Abstract: Agroforestry systems can be an effective means of stabilizing or even enhancing crop yields under climate change. Although trees compete with crops for soil resources in agroforestry,they can also improve crops' growing conditions, especially, by providing shade under drought. They can promote higher crop yields and higher harvest quality in the drylands. However, the beneficial effect of tree shade may depend on the seasonal pattern of rainfall, which determines the compensation between yield components. In this study, we evaluated two annual crops (durum wheat and faba bean) in olive agroforestry in northern Morocco. We manipulated water supply in a field experiment to span the high inter-annual rainfall variability at the site and tested whether olive trees reduce or improve crop yields. We assessed the effect of water addition on crop growth, yield components, and final yields and estimated the land equivalent ratio of olive agroforestry. Agroforestry limited crop growth and yield whatever the water regime. The magnitude of grain yield reduction was around 50 % for both crops in 2018, probably due to shade. The number of grains per unit area was the most impacted yield component in both 2018 and 2019. In contrast, water addition only had limited effects on faba bean yield, although it enhanced wheat grain yield by 11 % and the number of wheat spikes by 13 %. Agroforestry improved individual grain weight by 39 % for wheat and 17 % for faba bean, and enhanced the protein content of wheat grains and straw by 4 % and 9 %. However, improvements in grain weight and in protein content were not sufficient to compensate for yield loss due to shade. Despite lower crop yields, we show that agroforestry systems are still more land productive than sole crops and trees, even under arid conditions. We show how changing water supply may impact the performance of olive agroforestry in a drier future.

Abstract: Despite its potential for fostering farm sustainability, the adoption of agroforestry faces context-dependent challenges, among which the (perceived) shortage of decision-supporting tools and barriers hindering the assessment of economic, environmental, and social benefits. The process of digitalization offers significant opportunities to enhance sustainability, but it remains crucial to foster a human-centric, fair, and sustainable approach. In the context of the DigitAF Horizon Europe project, we present the results of a multi-stakeholder questionnaire aimed at understanding the perceptions of stakeholders regarding agroforestry and digitalization, as well as the needs of these stakeholders for a successful implementation of this agricultural practice. In the questionnaire, there was a specific focus on the need for and the conditions for the use of digital tools and models, such as generalized digital tools, applications and mapping, climate and weather forecasting and recording, farm management and decision support, and agroforestry and environmental tools. The purpose of this survey was to provide insights to inform agroforestry actors and to foster collaborative initiatives that enhance the potential of digital tools to support the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective and sustainable agroforestry in the European context. Our questionnaire was completed by stakeholders from seven European countries, including farmers, academics, policy actors, farm advisors, and actors in the value chain with an interest in agroforestry. Stakeholders from six living labs, representing Czechia, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK, were involved in the appraisal, along with a multi-stakeholder group from Belgium. Respondents used data and digital tools for various purposes in farming systems and were interested in their potential to improve agroforestry including animal, tree, and crop performance, management guidance, system design, and tree species selection. Our survey revealed that the perceived usefulness of digital tools for agroforestry was substantially higher than stakeholders' awareness of existing tools, indicating a need for better promotion and development of user-friendly, accessible solutions. Additionally, significant obstacles to agroforestry adoption, such as large up-front investments, administrative burdens, and fear of reduced CAP support, were identified, emphasizing the necessity for targeted support and policy improvements. Moving forward, efforts should focus on developing targeted solutions to promote agroforestry according to stakeholder perception, and user-friendly digital tools tailored to the needs and preferences expressed by stakeholders, while also increasing knowledge sharing and capacity building among practitioners and researchers.

Abstract: Water scarcity is already set to be one of the main issues of the 21st century, because of competing needs between civil, industrial, and agricultural use. Agriculture is currently the largest user of water, but its share is bound to decrease as societies develop and clearly it needs to become more water efficient. Improving water use efficiency (WUE) at the plant level is important, but translating this at the farm/landscape level presents considerable challenges. As we move up from the scale of cells, organs, and plants to more integrated scales such as plots, fields, farm systems, and landscapes, other factors such as trade-offs need to be considered to try to improve WUE. These include choices of crop variety/species, farm management practices, landscape design, infrastructure development, and ecosystem functions, where human decisions matter. This review is a cross-disciplinary attempt to analyse approaches to addressing WUE at these different scales, including definitions of the metrics of analysis and consideration of trade-offs. The equations we present in this perspectives paper use similar metrics across scales to make them easier to connect and are developed to highlight which levers, at different scales, can improve WUE. We also refer to models operating at these different scales to assess WUE. While our entry point is plants and crops, we scale up the analysis of WUE to farm systems and landscapes. This review considers approaches to improving water use efficiency beyond the whole-plant level, across scales of time and space, from cells, organs, and plants, to fields, farms, and landscapes.

Abstract: In the face of increasing agricultural demands and environmental concerns, the effective management of weeds presents a pressing challenge in modern agriculture. Weeds not only compete with crops for resources but also pose threats to food safety and agricultural sustainability through the indiscriminate use of herbicides, which can lead to environmental contamination and herbicide-resistant weed populations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a paradigm shift in agriculture, particularly in the domain of weed management. AI's utilization in this domain extends beyond mere innovation, offering precise and eco-friendly solutions for the identification and control of weeds, thereby addressing critical agricultural challenges. This article aims to examine the application of AI in weed management in the context of weed detection and the increasing impact of deep learning techniques in the agricultural sector. Through an assessment of research articles, this study identifies critical factors influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in weed management. These criteria encompass factors of AI adoption (food safety, increased effectiveness, and eco-friendliness through herbicides reduction), AI implementation factors (capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and outcomes and accuracy), ancillary technologies (IoT, UAV, field robots, and herbicides), and the related impact of AI methods adoption (economic, social, technological, and environmental). Of the 5821 documents found, 99 full-text articles were assessed, and 68 were included in this study. The review highlights AI's role in enhancing food safety by reducing herbicide residues, increasing effectiveness in weed control strategies, and promoting ecofriendliness through judicious herbicide use. It underscores the importance of capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and accuracy metrics in AI implementation, emphasizing their synergy in revolutionizing weed management practices. Ancillary technologies, such as IoT, UAVs, field robots, and AI-enhanced herbicides, complement AI's capabilities, offering holistic and data-driven approaches to weed control. Additionally, the adoption of AI methods influences economic, social, technological, and environmental dimensions of agriculture. Last but not least, digital literacy emerges as a crucial enabler, empowering stakeholders to navigate AI technologies effectively and contribute to the sustainable transformation of weed management practices in agriculture.

Abstract: Background Plants have adapted to survive seasonal life-threatening frost and drought. However, the timing and frequency of such events are impacted by climate change, jeopardizing plant survival. Understanding better the strategies of survival to dehydration stress is therefore timely and can be enhanced by the cross-fertilization of research between disciplines (ecology, physiology), models (woody, herbaceous species) and types of stress (drought, frost). Scope We build upon the 'growth-stress survival' trade-off, which underpins the identification of global plant strategies across environments along a 'fast-slow' economics spectrum. Although phenological adaptations such as dormancy are crucial to survive stress, plant global strategies along the fast-slow economic spectrum rarely integrate growth variations across seasons. We argue that the growth-stress survival trade-off can be a useful framework to identify convergent plant ecophysiological strategies to survive both frost and drought. We review evidence that reduced physiological activity, embolism resistance and dehydration tolerance of meristematic tissues are interdependent strategies that determine thresholds of mortality among plants under severe frost and drought. We show that complete dormancy, i.e. programmed growth cessation, before stress occurrence, minimizes water flows and maximizes dehydration tolerance during seasonal life-threatening stresses. We propose that incomplete dormancy, i.e. the programmed reduction of growth potential during the harshest seasons, could be an overlooked but major adaptation across plants. Quantifying stress survival in a range of non-dormant versus winter- or summer-dormant plants, should reveal to what extent incomplete to complete dormancy could represent a proxy for dehydration tolerance and stress survival. Conclusions Our review of the strategies involved in dehydration stress survival suggests that winter and summer dormancy are insufficiently acknowledged as plant ecological strategies. Incorporating a seasonal fast-slow economics spectrum into global plant strategies improves our understanding of plant resilience to seasonal stress and refines our prevision of plant adaptation to extreme climatic events.

Abstract: Weed management in large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSS-PV) farms has become a great concern to the solar industry due to scarcity of labour and the ever-increasing price of pesticides, which opens up possibilities for integrated farming, also known as agrivoltaics. Improper weed control may have multiple negative impacts such as permanent shading of the module surface, pest housing which damages communication cables, and even bush fires. The shaded PV modules can be heated up to extreme temperatures, causing costly burn-out damage. Critical information on the types of weeds on solar farms, especially in Malaysia, has not been established to support the concept of weed management. Thus, with this study, detailed composition of the weed community was obtained via quadrat sampling between solar PV modules, near ground equipment, near perimeter fencing, and directly underneath the PV modules. Weed-control measures via high-quality weedmat installation under solar PV arrays have been implemented where this approach can be considered effective on solar farms based on the existing PV structure height and equipment constraints plus the increasing cost for labour and agricultural inputs. This work underlines the proposed Agrivoltaic for Large Scale Solar (Agrivoltaic4LSS) program to complement the solar industry in Malaysia towards an agrivoltaic, eco-friendly approach to weed management.
