Abstract: Key message Results demonstrate that the 2,4-D can affect physiological and molecular parameters of vitrocultures when used at high concentrations without hampering their morphogenetic capacities. It was found to be efficient at inducing genetic and epigenetic variations. The present study is a part of a program designed at improving the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera L. cv. Barhee, through induced somaclonal variation. In this work, caulogenic cultures were subcultured on MS media supplemented with 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg L-1 2,4-D in order to induce genetic and epigenetic variations. The highest doses of 2,4-D were found to induce severe negative effects on in vitro cultures, although some tissues were able to survive and to produce calli with high morphogenetic capacities. Our analysis showed some significant effect of 2,4-D on several physiological parameters. Indeed, chlorophyll and growth rates were found to drastically decrease while proline content increased from 535 to 2973 nmol g(-1) FW when 40 mg L-1 2,4-D were used. In vitro cultures showed several signs of oxidative stress, such as high levels of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde; likewise, the specific activity of several antioxidant enzyme was found to increase. Plant regeneration from in vitro cultures treated with 2,4-D was obtained after subculturing explants onto PGR-free media. The ISSR analysis of 2,4-D-treated material showed that this plant growth regulator (PGR) induced measurable genetic variations. The global DNA methylation rates (GMR) as estimated through the HPLC analysis of nucleosides also confirmed the presence of epigenetic changes caused by 2,4-D as GMRs increased from 13.8 to 18.93%.

Abstract: Objectives The present study aimed to explore the eliciting effects of increasing concentrations (50, 100, and 200 mu M) of methyl jasmonate (MeJA). We cultivated actively proliferating buds of Phoenix dactylifera L. cv. Barhee in a temporary immersion system and we monitored the bioactive compound accumulation after 7 days of culture. Methods Total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) contents were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and radical scavenging activity using DPPH and ABTS assays. We also explored the activity of phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes, namely phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Results Our results revealed that MeJA treatment induced oxidative stress, and at the same time increased the activity of related defense enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. Exogenous application of MeJA at 200 mu M increased ROS (two fold), hydrogen peroxide (3.7 fold), nitric oxide (14 fold), MDA (6.3 fold), superoxide dismutase (5.9 fold), catalase (4.4 fold) and guaiacol peroxidase (3.87 fold). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that 200 mu M MeJA treatment enhanced the activities of PAL (3.65 fold), TAL (4.35 fold), PPO (threefold) and increased TPC (twofold) and TFC (1.75 fold) contents in buds cultures higher than the control. HPLC analysis showed that buds cultures exposed to 200 mu M MeJA accumulated maximum amount of catechin (11 fold), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (1.48 fold), caffeic acid (2.5 fold) and p-coumaric acid (1.76 fold) and demonstrate antioxidant capacity with the lowest DPPH (114.5 mu g ml(-1)) and ABTS (90.2 mu g ml(-1)) IC50 values on day 7 of culture as compared to the control. The MeJA in the culture medium directly reduced cell viability in a dose dependent manner up to 35% with the highest concentration. Conclusion The results of this study has revealed, for the first time, that MeJA offers a promising potential for the production of phenolic compound in Phoenix dactylifera L. buds.

Abstract: This study investigates spatial-temporal trends in N2O emissions from coffee production systems in Costa Rica with a focus on the effects of nitrogen fertilisation, topography and soil type. This is done by combining (i) multiyear continuous dynamic chamber measurements from sites with different fertilisation levels, (ii) static chamber measurements taken along a typical sloping coffee field and (iii) measurements from a laboratory incubation experiment with nutrient addition to different soil types. In the field and in the laboratory, additions included standard NPK fertiliser, ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) as well as potassium nitrate (KNO3). Soils in a laboratory experiment were incubated under both drained and flooded conditions. Continuous measurements from automatic chambers show that annual N2O fluxes were dominated by bursts over few weeks following N-fertilisation with peak emissions up to 60 g N-N2O ha(-1) day(-1). A two-month slope experiment with static chambers after KNO3-fertilisation with 90 kg N ha 1 showed N2O significant differences between the highest daily emission rates from the top and the bottom of the slope (134 +/- 20 g N-N2O ha(-1) and 336 +/- 104 g N-N2O ha(-1), respectively) which can be explained by NO3- transport downhill and flooded conditions favouring denitrification at the bottom of the slope. Incubation experiments indicate that denitrification is the main process controlling N2O emissions but also that nitrification can result in low N2O emission rates under drained conditions. It can be concluded that the reported N2O emissions from the coffee agroforestry systems are generally low, but may be underestimated, as both poorly drained depressions functioning as N2O hotspots as well as temporal N2O bursts need to be taken into account.

Abstract: Purpose Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a key role in soil functioning and in greenhouse gas exchange with the atmosphere. Land use and land use changes can critically affect SOC. However, despite various methodological developments, there is still no scientific consensus on the best method to assess the holistic impact of land use and land use change within LCA. The SOCLE project aimed to review how SOC contribution to climate change is accounted for in LCA and to test the feasibility and sensitivity of best methodological options. Methods In total, five crop products (annual/perennial, temperate/tropical) and two livestock products were investigated through 22 scenarios of land use changes (LUC) and agricultural land management changes (LMC). Three methods were applied: IPCC Tier 1-2 (2006), Muller-Wenk and Brandao (2010) and Levasseur et al. (2012). We also carried out a sensitivity analysis on key variables, notably carbon stocks, reference states, and regeneration times. Results and discussion The accounting for LUC and LMC influenced greatly the results on the climate change impact. Compared to the impact of other GHG emissions, (i) LUC impacts ranged from - 23 to + 1702% with the IPCC method and from - 5 to + 336% with the Muller-Wenk and Brandao method, and (ii) LMC impacts from - 130 to + 54% and from - 31 to + 11%, respectively. The sensitivity analyses stressed the critical influence of all methodological and data choices on final results. Conclusions Based on the project results, we recommend accounting systematically for the impact of LULUC on climate change by applying,a minima, the comprehensive IPCC Tier 1 approach (2006), which provides default factors for SOC accounting. Where available, case-specific data should be used (e.g., Tier 2) for SOC stocks but also C:N ratio in order to model the degressive impact over 90% of the time period needed to reach equilibrium.

Abstract: Description of the subject. With increasing concerns on the sustainability of agricultural systems, many tools have been developed to assess farm sustainability. Objectives. The main objective of this study was to assess and compare the sustainability of different forms of family farm organization. A second objective was to test the relevance of the IDEA method (Indicateurs de Durabilite des Exploitations Agricoles or Farm Sustainability Indicators) to compare tree-crop-based family farms in tropical areas. Method. Percentages of sustainability were calculated based on individual interviews conducted with 25 rubber fanners representing three different types of farm (typology based on the labor used for farming activities), using three scales and 10 components. Results. The socio-territorial scale was the weak point of the rubber farms. In contrast, the economic scale was relatively the best asset on all farms. The factor that most differentiated the three types of farm was the agro-ecological scale followed by the socio-territorial scale. The economic scale did not discriminate. Moreover, only the diversity of production and efficiency components showed a notable difference between the different types of farm. Conclusions. Overall, the three types of farm with contrasting forms of farm organization were not much different in terms of sustainability performance. Family business farms with managerial family labor appeared to be the least sustainable. Thus, as family business farms are becoming more and more important in Thai agriculture, if these results are confirmed on a broader scale, this represents an issue for the sustainability of the Thai rubber sector that would require government intervention.

Abstract: Existing methods that apply the planetary boundaiy for the nitrogen cycle in life cycle assessment are spatially generic and use an indicator with limited environmental relevance. Here, we develop a spatially resolved method that can quantify the impact of nitrogen emissions to air, soil, freshwater or coastal water on "safe operating space" (SOS) for natural soil, freshwater and coastal water. The method can be used to identify potential "planetary boundary hotspots" in the life cycle of products and to inform appropriate interventions. The method is based on a coupling of existing environmental models and the identification of threshold and reference values in natural soil, freshwater and coastal water. The method is demonstrated for a case study on nitrogen emissions from open-field tomato production in 27 farming areas based on data for 199 farms in the year 2014. Nitrogen emissions were modelled from farm-level data on fertilizer application, fuel consumption and dimate- and soil conditions. Two sharing principles, "status quo" and "gross value added", were tested for the assignment of SOS to 1 t of tomatoes. The coupling of models and identification of threshold and reference values resulted in spatially resolved characterization factors applicable to any nitrogen emission and estimations of SOS for each environmental compartment. In the case study, tomato production was found to range from not transgressing to transgressing its assigned SOS in each of the 27 farming areas, depending on the receiving compartment and sharing principle. A high nitrogen use efficiency scenario had the potential to reverse transgressions of assigned SOS for up to three farming locations. Despite of several sources of uncertainty, the developed method may be used in decision-support by stakeholders, ranging from individual producers to global governance institutions. To avoid sub-optimization, it should be applied with methods covering the other planetary boundaries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This article follows on from two articles published in 2014 and 2018 on the same trial conducted in an oil palm plantation in Nigeria which was aimed at assessing a range of different planting distances between oil palms (7.5 to 9.5 m) in an equilateral triangle design. The climate in the region is very stable, with two seasons and an average 2000 mm of rainfall per year. The soil is of the desaturated ferralitic type, sandy on the surface, deep, and without coarse elements. After continually monitoring the experimental palms for 16 years, there is now enough hindsight to propose an optimum planting density for oil palms in Western Africa. A plateau has been reached at between 143 and 160 palms per hectare for Pobe C1001F material in the aforementioned pedoclimatic context.

Abstract: Hevea brasiliensis is the greatest source of natural rubber and raw material in several industrial products manufacture. In Colombia, it has been commercially established in five productive units; however, the genetic basis is limited and foliar diseases have influenced the development and the production. In La Libertad Research Center (Villavicencio) and Taluma Experimental Field (Puerto L & oacute;pez) of the Corporaci & oacute;n Colombiana de Investigaci & oacute;n Agropecuaria - AGROSAVIA, clonal trials, at small-scale and large-scale, were established to evaluate the performance assessment, associated with growth, of seven clones from CIRAD-Michelin selection Collection series CDC, FDR, MDF y PMB, and FX 3864 and RRIM 600 as well. In juvenile stage, the trunk circumference (CIRC) was measured every six months, and the annual increase average (IMA-CIRC) was calculated. Variance analysis and means comparison were carried out. At eight years of age, the FDR 5788 clone showed IMA-CIRC of 8.20 cm year-1 and 6.87 cm year-1 in La Libertad and Taluma, respectively; differences in growth between clones were observed. In the Piedemonte llanero (La Libertad), the FDR 5788 and RRIM 600 clones were notable for their growth, whereas in the Altilllanura (Puerto L & oacute;pez) PMB 1 and FDR 5788 were remarkable. In La Libertad, the FDR 5788, RRIM 600 and CDC 312 clones exceeded the CIRC of 50 cm at sixth year, in contrast to Taluma, where it occurred at seventh year for PMB1 and DFR 5788.

Abstract: To contribute to the debate on labour and the ways of farming, this study tested the relevance of a labour-based typology to discriminate among forms of production operating in the Thai rubber sector. The data used came from surveys with 469 farmers. The case of Thai rubber-based family farms is specific but also brings generic insights to the debate. Classifying the farms based on their mode of organisation helps in understanding farmers' overall strategies regarding farming and non-farm activities. These differences were important and were linked to the capacity of family labour to develop non-farm activities. However, surprisingly, no discrimination among the types of farms appeared based on the agricultural production system. This finding appeared counter-intuitive given the importance of hired labour in rubber family farming. The non-significant differences for the practices and the land and labour productivities engaged in rubber cropping could be linked to the use of share-croppers (and not wage employees) as external labour. Further research needs to identify factors that can unlock productivity in the rubber plantations, whatever the category of holding. The importance of pluri-activity has strong implications that will require expanding empirical works focusing on labour issues.

Abstract: Field latex is an important raw material in Thailand, produced by a large number of smallholders and handled by numerous local traders. This diversity of stakeholders involved along the production and marketing chain could result in the variability of the latex quality delivered to the factories. Latex processing industries need a raw material with consistently specified properties. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the factors that could affect latex properties. However, a complete description of the practices from the farmer to the factory is missing. Thus, a study was conducted to (1) characterise the upstream practices, (2) identify variable practices and (3) analyse farmers' and traders' perceptions of field latex quality that are believed to influence their practices. A survey was conducted with 398 field latex producers and 182 field latex traders distributed in eight provinces of Southern Thailand. The results showed that some agronomic practices in the mature plantations presented homogeneity (planting material, weed control, management of the inter-row of the plantations) while others (fertilisation, tapping panel treatment, harvesting practices) presented important diversity. Farmers' and traders' post-harvest practices presented limited sources of contamination. Nonetheless, for both stakeholders, an important possible source of variability was the quantity of latex preservative used. Finally, the analysis of the practices and the perception of the stakeholders clearly showed that field latex quality was determined both before and after harvesting. Research is still needed to analyse the impact of some agronomic practices on field latex quality. Latex traders also appeared as key stakeholders dealing with the quality.

Abstract: Coffee beans are a major agricultural product and coffee is one of the most widely traded commodities and consumed beverages globally. Supply chains and cropping systems are very diverse, with contrasted potentials and performance, as well as environmental impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies are needed to inform on reduction in impacts, but there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the variability of existing LCA results and impacts of the cropping systems and their trade-offs along the supply chains. In an attempt to address this knowledge gap, the paper presents a systematic literature review of coffee LCA, considering a total of 34 studies covering 234 coffee systems. Global warming potential (GWP) was the impact category most reported in the literature, but the results varied greatly at both the farm and drink levels. For the former, the GWP values ranged from 0.15 to 14.5 (median: 3.6) kg CO 2 eq./kg green coffee beans and for the latter the values ranged from 2 to 23 (median: 8.8) kg CO 2 eq./kg consumed coffee in drinks. Main contributors to the GWP of production of green coffee beans were land use change (LUC), fertilisers and wet processing. However, there were great inconsistencies across studies in terms of LUC accounting, field emissions and wet process modelling. Green coffee beans production was also the main contributor to the GWP of coffee consumed, followed by brewing and coffee cup washing. Some studies covered other impacts, in addition to GWP. At both the farm and drink levels, fertilisers and pesticides were the main contributors to eutrophication and acidification, and to ecotoxicity, respectively. Brewing was the second main contributor at the drink level, in some cases the top contributor for energy -related indicators. Assumptions on packaging, cup washing and waste disposal were highly variable across studies. Water impact indicators were hardly comparable due to the system variability and method inconsistencies. Given the large diversity of coffee cropping systems worldwide, but also the diversity of possible coffee drinks, we recommend that LCA studies be standardised with respect to the definition of the functional unit, including consistent quality aspects for both green coffee beans (moisture) and coffee drinks (organoleptic properties). They should also be more thorough in detailing processes at all stages. More attention should be paid to the farming system complexity and a mass balance should be ensured when assessing biomass flows concerning LUC, co -products and residue emissions. Finally, more primary data would be needed to decipher the cropping system diversity, as well as to characterise emissions from all inputs to the field and bean processing, notably for wet and semi -wet processing.

Abstract: Improving the productivity of existing rubber plantations is necessary to cope with the growing demand for natural rubber (NR) while limiting the environmental and social impacts linked to the expansion of rubber cultivation at the expense of natural ecosystems and food crops. The effect of fertilization on NR yield is still unclear and is poorly documented particularly in Thailand, the world leader in NR production. Hence, the main objective of this study was to re-assess the possible effects of fertilization on the yield of intensively managed rubber plantations in Thailand. Our main hypothesis was that the effect of fertilization would be higher with intensive latex harvesting practices (high tapping frequency with ethylene stimulation). To test this hypothesis, we set-up a split-plot experiment with four fertilization doses (T1, no fertilization, T2, T3, T4, respectively low, medium and high doses of NPK fertilizer) and two tapping systems (S/2 d2 with and without ethylene stimulation). Here, we present the results of the first three years on dry rubber yield, latex metabolism assessed with the latex diagnosis method, and latex and rubber properties related to their technological properties. Our results showed a positive effect of fertilization on yield from the first year, but the effect was only statistically significant (p < 0.05) in the third year. The maximum effect of fertilization (+13%) compared to the control treatment (T1) was obtained with the highest dose of fertilizer (T4). Cumulatively over the 3-year period, the increase in yield was +5% with the T2 dose, and +8% with the T3 and T4 dose. Contrary to our main assumption, we observed no interaction between fertilization and ethylene stimulation. Latex diagnosis revealed that the effect of fertilization on yield was linked with a direct effect on latex metabolism mainly through an increase in inorganic phosphorus content (Pi). Finally, we observed no detrimental effect of the fertilizer treatments on latex and rubber quality. We can thus conclude that increasing latex yield through fertilization combined with intensive tapping does not involve any identified risks for the quality of rubber. Taken together, our results demonstrate that fertilization can help increase the yield of rubber plantations where intensive latex harvesting is practised. However, in a context of low NR prices for rubber farmers, the economic return of a +8% increase in yield is questionable. Our trial is continuing to assess the long term effects of the fertilization on yield as well as on the growth and nutritional status of the trees, and the nutrient balance of the plantation.

Abstract: K deficiency and waterlogging are common stresses that can occur simultaneously and impact on crop development and yield. They are both known to affect catabolism, with rather opposite effects: inhibition of glycolysis and higher glycolytic fermentative flux, respectively. But surprisingly, the effect of their combination on plant metabolism has never been examined precisely. Here, we applied a combined treatment (K availability and waterlogging) to sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants under controlled greenhouse conditions and performed elemental quantitation, metabolomics, and isotope analyses at different sampling times. Whereas separate K deficiency and waterlogging caused well-known effects such as polyamines production and sugar accumulation, respectively, waterlogging altered K-induced respiration enhancement (via the C-5-branched acid pathway) and polyamine production, and K deficiency tended to suppress waterlogging-induced accumulation of Krebs cycle intermediates in leaves. Furthermore, the natural N-15/N-14 isotope composition (delta N-15) in leaf compounds shows that there was a change in nitrate circulation, with less nitrate influx to leaves under low K availablity combined with waterlogging and more isotopic dilution of lamina nitrates under high K. Our results show that K deficiency and waterlogging effects are not simply additive, reshape respiration as well as nitrogen metabolism and partitioning, and are associated with metabolomic and isotopic biomarkers of potential interest for crop monitoring.

Abstract: Potassium (K) deficiency is a rather common situation that impacts negatively on biomass, photosynthesis and N assimilation, making K fertilization often unavoidable. Effects of K deficiency have been investigated for several decades and recently progress has been made in identifying metabolomics signatures thereby offering potential to monitor the K status of crops in the field. However, effects of low K conditions could also be due to the antagonism with other nutrients like calcium (Ca) and the well-known biomarker of K deficiency, putrescine, could be a response to Ca/K imbalance rather than K deficiency per se. To sort this out, we carried out experiments in sunflower grown at either low or high K, at high or low Ca, with or without putrescine added to the nutrient solution. Using metabolomics and proteomics analysis, we show that a significant part of the low K response, such as lower photosynthesis and N assimilation, is due to calcium and can be suppressed by low Ca conditions. Putrescine addition tends to restore photosynthesis and N assimilation but unlike low Ca does not suppress but aggravates the impact of low K conditions on catabolism, including the typical fall-over in pyruvate kinase. We conclude that (a) the effects of K deficiency on key metabolic processes can be partly alleviated by the use of low Ca and not only by K fertilization and (b) in addition to its role as a metabolite, putrescine participates in acclimation to low K via the regulation of the content in enzymes involved in carbon primary metabolism.

Abstract: Oil palm is by far the major oil-producing crop on the global scale, with c. 62 Mt oil produced each year. This species is a strong potassium (K)-demanding species cultivated in regions where soil K availability is generally low and waterlogging due to tropical heavy rains can limit further nutrient absorption. However, the metabolic effects of K and waterlogging have never been assessed precisely. Here, we examined the metabolic response of oil palm saplings in the glasshouse under controlled conditions (nutrient composition with low or high K availability, with or without waterlogging), using gas exchange, metabolomics and proteomics analyses. Our results showed that both low K and waterlogging have a detrimental effect on photosynthesis but stimulate leaf respiration, with differential accumulation of typical metabolic intermediates and enzymes of Krebs cycle and alternative catabolic pathways. In addition, we found a strong relationship between metabolic composition, the rate of leaf dark respiration, and cumulated respiratory loss. Advert environmental conditions (here, low K and waterlogging) therefore have an enormous effect on respiration in oil palm. Leaf metabolome and proteome appear to be good predictors of carbon balance, and open avenues for cultivation biomonitoring using functional genomics technologies.

Abstract: Societal Impact Statement Oil palm is the first oil-producing crop globally, representing nearly 20 million ha. In the recent past, oil palm cultivation has been controversial not only because of land utilisation at the expense of primary tropical forests or health concerns associated with palm oil, but also pollution caused by fertilization (including CO2 produced to synthesise fertilizers). Oil palm fields are heavily fertilized with potassium (K), and thus finding better, more parsimonious methods to monitor K nutrition is more important than ever. Here, we suggest that metabolomics and subsequent machine learning of metabolic signatures represent a promising tool to probe K requirements, opening avenues for precision agriculture in oil palm industry.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) assimilation is associated with N-14/N-15 fractionation such that plant tissues are generally N-15-depleted compared to source nitrate. In addition to nitrate concentration, the delta N-15 value in plants is also influenced by isotopic heterogeneity amongst organs and metabolites. However, our current understanding of delta N-15 values in nitrate is limited by the relatively small number of compound-specific data. We extensively measured delta N-15 in nitrate at different time points, in sunflower and oil palm grown at fixed nitrate concentration, with nitrate circulation being varied using potassium (K) conditions and waterlogging. There were strong interorgan delta N-15 differences for contrasting situations between the two species, and a high N-15-enrichment in root nitrate. Modelling shows that this N-15-enrichment can be explained by nitrate circulation and compartmentalisation whereby despite a numerically small flux value, the backflow of nitrate to roots via the phloem can lead to a c. 30 parts per thousand difference between leaves and roots. Accordingly, waterlogging and low K conditions, which down-regulate sap circulation, cause a decrease in the leaf-to-root isotopic difference. Our study thus suggests that plant delta N-15 can be used as a natural tracer of N fluxes between organs and highlights the potential importance of delta N-15 of circulating phloem nitrate.

Abstract: Metabolic effects of potassium (K) deficiency have been described for nearly 70 years but specific effects of low K availability on sugar composition, sugar export rate and its relationship with other leaf metabolites are not very well documented. Having such pieces of information is nevertheless essential to identify metabolic signatures to monitor K fertilization. This is particularly true in oil-producing crop species such as oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which is strongly K-demanding and involves high sugar dependence for fruit formation because of low carbon use efficiency in lipid synthesis. Here, we used metabolic analyses, measured sugar export rates with C-13 isotopic labeling and examined the effects of K availability on both leaflet and rachis sugar metabolism in oil palm seedlings. We show that low K leads to a modification of sugar composition mostly in rachis and decreased sucrose and hexose export rates from leaflets. As a result, leaflets contained more starch and induced alternative pathways such as raffinose synthesis, although metabolites of the raffinose pathway remained quantitatively minor. The alteration of glycolysis by low K was compensated for by an increase in alternative sugar phosphate utilization by tyrosine metabolism, resulting in considerable amounts of tyramine and dopamine.

Abstract: Oil palm is an oil-producing crop of major importance at the global scale. Oil palm mesocarp lipids are used for myriads industrial applications, and market demand has been growing for decades. In addition, oil palm seeds are oleaginous, and the oil extracted therefrom can be used for several purposes, from food to cosmetics. As such, there is a huge need in oil palm seeds to maintain the global cohort of more than 2 billion trees. However, oil palm seed germination is a rather difficult process, not only to break dormancy, but also because it is long and often reaches lower-than-expected germination rates. Surprisingly, despite the crucial importance of germination for oil palm plantation management, our knowledge is still rather limited, in particular about germinating oil palm seed metabolism. The present review incorporates different pieces of information that have been obtained in the past few years, in oil palm and in other palm species, in order to provide an overview of germination metabolism and its control. Further insights can also be gained from other oleaginous model plants, such asArabidopsisor canola, however, palm seeds have peculiarities that must be accounted for, to gain a better understanding of germinating seed metabolism.

Abstract: Biomarker metabolites are of increasing interest in crops since they open avenues for precision agriculture, whereby nutritional needs and stresses can be monitored optimally. Putrescine has the potential to be a useful biomarker to reveal potassium (K+) deficiency. In fact, although this diamine has also been observed to increase during other stresses such as drought, cold or heavy metals, respective changes are comparably low. Due to its multifaceted biochemical properties, several roles for putrescine under K+ deficiency have been suggested, such as cation balance, antioxidant, reactive oxygen species mediated signalling, osmolyte or pH regulator. However, the specific association of putrescine build-up with low K+ availability in plants remains poorly understood, and possible regulatory roles must be consistent with putrescine concentration found in plant tissues. We hypothesize that the massive increase of putrescine upon K+ starvation plays an adaptive role. A distinction of putrescine function from that of other polyamines (spermine, spermidine) may be based either on its specificity or (which is probably more relevant under K+ deficiency) on a very high attainable concentration of putrescine, which far exceeds those for spermidine and spermine. putrescine and its catabolites appear to possess a strong potential in controlling cellular K+ and Ca2+, and mitochondria and chloroplasts bioenergetics under K+ stress.

Abstract: Background and aims In oil palm, similar fertilization treatments can result in leaflet potassium and magnesium concentrations that vary significantly from one progeny to another. This hinders the development of standardized fertilizer recommendations for this crop, as they are usually calculated based on optimum leaflet nutrient concentrations. Methods Four high-yielding oil palm progenies with contrasting leaflet K and Mg concentrations (C1, C2, and C3 of Deli x La Me origin and C4 of Deli x Yangambi origin) were treated with combinations of three levels of KCl and MgSO4, in a completely randomized split-plot factorial design with six replicates, where progenies were a sub-factor. Results For a given level of KCl or MgSO4, different leaflet K and Mg concentrations were found between progenies (p < 0.0001). Leaflet K concentration and yield response to KCl applications revealed that the four oil palm progenies have different optimum leaflet K concentrations. In our study period (5-8 YAP), progenies C1 and C3 showed their highest fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yields (13.62 and 16.54 t ha(-1) year(-1), respectively) at K2, whereas progenies C2 and C4 showed their highest yields (14.62 and 12.39 t ha(-1) year(-1), respectively) at K1. Conclusion Our study highlighted specific optimum leaflet K and Mg concentrations for different oil palm progenies in a given environment. It paves the way for adopting K and Mg fertilizer application rates adapted to specific requirements of each type of oil palm planting material.

Abstract: We compared four oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) progenies' morphological growth characteristics to reveal genotypic differences in plant growth and assess their adaptability in Nigeria's environment in response to different levels of potassium chloride (KC1) and kieserite fertilizer applications. The studied progenies (C1, C2 and C3 of Deli x La Me origin and C4 of Deli x Yangambi origin) represent a wide genetic diversity of oil palm and have shown among a population of 116 different progenies, a contrasting K and Mg leaflet concentrations that covered the extreme ranges of leaflet concentrations in these minerals. The trial consisted of a completely randomized split-plot factorial design with six replicates, where progenies, considered as sub-factor were treated with combinations of 3 levels ofpotassium chloride (0, 1.5, 3.0 kg of KCl palm(-1) year(-1)) and kieserite (0, 0.75, 1.5 kg of MgSO4 palm(-1) year(-1))fertilizers (main factor), respectively. Growth characteristics differed significantly among progenies, but not in all studied years. In all progenies, KCl treatments significantly increased the average annual collar girth increment and projected canopy area. Adding 3.0 kg palm(-1) year(-1) of KCl significantly increased the total leaf area of progeny C4. Kieserite applications did not have an effect on progenies' growth characteristics whereas potassium showed to be the main mineral needed for oil palm growth. It was shown that with equal amounts of fertilizers applied, progeny C3 had better morphological traits than the other progenies, suggesting that the effective nutrient requirements should be assessed for each individual progeny and that fertilization should be adapted accordingly.

Abstract: Oil palm fertilizer requirements are based on leaflet mineral concentrations. Four oil palm progenies representing a wide genetic diversity of Elaeis guineensis species and with contrasting K and Mg leaflet concentrations were tested in Indonesia and Nigeria, environments which differ predominantly in climate. During 5 years, we compared oil palm progenies' leaflet mineral concentrations between both countries under abundant fertilizer applications to investigate the extent to which they depend on the environment. In the two studied environments, leaflet concentrations significantly differed between progenies for K, Mg and Ca, but the country effect was not found significant (p = 0.352) for any leaflet mineral's concentration. In both countries, progenies ranked similarly in their mineral categories (lowest and highest cation concentrations within the 4 progenies population), indicating that leaflet mineral concentrations in the tested oil palm progenies are mainly determined by their genetic background. For each progeny, with abundant fertilization, K, Mg and Ca proportions to total leaf cation charge (TLCC) were similar, irrespective of the environments in which the palms were cultivated. We have strong indications that foliar concentrations of K, Mg and Ca are determined by genetic factors which dominate the environmental effect. However, it remains uncertain whether differences in oil palm foliar concentrations between different oil palm progenies imply that they require specific fertilizer amounts to attain an optimal production.

Abstract: Predicting the fertilizer requirements of an oil palm plantation has long been a difficult task. Two main methods have emerged. Leaf analyses (LA) were used for fertilization management as early as the 1950s. Leaf contents are compared to optimum references, making it possible to adjust the fertilizer rates applied in each block. Another approach, based on the nutrient balance (NB), is to evaluate and replace nutrients that are exported from the field, or immobilized by the plant. Plantations must adopt environmentally friendly practices; in particular, fertilizer inputs must be estimated with sufficient precision to achieve the highest possible yields, without applying excessive amounts of nutrients in relation to plant demand and the storage capacity of soils. We questioned the relevance of each method for achieving these objectives. We did so using some long-term fertilization trials to compare the optimum N and K rates recommended by each method in the adult phase. It appeared that LA led to moderate rates compared to NB. It also appeared that calculating a precise nutrient balance on a field scale was hampered by a lack of precise information (i) about the biomasses produced and their composition and (ii) about the highly variable outputs of the environmental losses. On the other hand, LA provided a simple indicator of the ability for each block to achieve its potential yield. We believe that this perfectible method is more protective of the environment, without the risk of a significant decrease in yields or a decrease in soil mineral reserves.

Abstract: In Ecuador, oil palm plantations from the Quininde-Quevedo region are subject to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with a preponderance of La Nina weather conditions. With more than 2,000 mm, the total annual rainfall is theoretically non-limiting but, with only 1,000 h, the total annual sunshine is well below the 1,800 h minimum recommended. Starting in the 1970s, the frequent occurrence of frond yellowing symptoms in the region became a recurrent worry for growers, convinced that they were facing the expression of a mineral deficiency. In this study, we used experimental results to examine the actual role of mineral nutrition in yellowing manifestation. We described the effects of two El Nino events (1982/1983 and 1997/1998) on climate variables and analysed their putative consequences on palm physiological functioning that could explain the observed foliage recovery. Our analysis led us to conclude that a direct mineral deficiency was not involved, as the soil reserves for the main nutrients were not to blame. We rejected the most frequently proposed hypothesis, whereby yellowing is caused by magnesium deficiency. Our study revealed the key role played by nitrogen, the best indicator of yellowing. Variations in N status appear to be linked to the same factors that determine the symptoms and we opted for the hypothesis of physiological disruption generated by low solar radiation levels under normal conditions. The study also reveals the need to consider specific optimum contents for N and Mg and to adjust fertilizer recommendations to local climate conditions.

Abstract: The environmental sustainability of biofuel production is still a debated issue in the world bio-economy development. Therefore, different researches are undergoing to evaluate the sustainability of ethanol production in different countries. This study aimed at analyzing the environmental performance of ethanol production in Ethiopia, considering energy balance and emission reduction using a life cycle assessment approach. It is also intended to identify the environmental hotspots so that possible improvement option can be devised. The life cycle assessment methodology was applied considering three alternative scenarios: 1) Base Case, which is the current situation, 2) Alternative 1, which considers the utilization of biogas from vinasse and bioslurry, and 3) Alternative 2, which includes mechanical harvesting and avoids pre-harvest cane trash burning. The results show that agricultural stage is greatly contributing to the pollutant emissions. The contribution of cane trash burning was significant to all the impact categories considered and avoiding pre-harvest cane trash burning significantly reduced the emissions contributing to global warming, acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, ozone formation, particulate matter and eutrophication. On the other hand, the introduction of mechanical harvesting to avoid pre-harvest cane trash burning increased ecotoxicity, human toxicity and resource consumption (land, water and mineral) impacts. The net energy balance is positive for all the alternatives considered. In addition to using by-products, proper management of fuel utilization at the agricultural stage can further enhance benefits from the sector. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the price of molasses highly influences both energy ratio and greenhouse gas emissions since it completely shifts the allocation of upstream emissions from sugar to molasses.

Abstract: The assessment of the impacts of land management on soil quality is crucial in the current environmental context. Among the many approaches available to assess soil quality, most of studies or monitoring programs consist in the measurement of stocks using an additive approach of physical, chemical and biological, parameters. More recently, functional methods have been developed to provide tools which better account the abioticbiotic interactions. The objective of our study was to evaluate and compare the capacity of physico-chemical, biological and functional parameters to assess the effect of land management on soil quality over a gradient of disturbance based on rubber tree plantations in Chachoengsao province, Thailand. Three sets of indicators were applied based on i. soil physico-chemical analyses, ii. biological analyses, based on soil free-living nematode indices iii. functional analyses, with Biofunctool (R) indicators linked to three main soil functions (carbon transformation, nutrient cycling, soil structure maintenance). A soil quality index resulting from the aggregation of each set of indicators into a single score showed that functional assessment was the most sensitive to the gradient of disturbance. Co-inertia analysis between sets revealed a significant relationship between functional analysis and both physico-chemical and biological sets of indicators, whereas the two latter were not related. Our results validated the ability of the functional method to better reflect the complexity of the abiotic-biotic interactions of the soil system.

Abstract: Tapping Panel Dryness (TPD) is a physiological disorder affecting natural rubber production in Hevea brasiliensis. TPD is associated with clonal susceptibility and overexploitation of rubber trees. Most studies are based on a binary point view of the absence or presence of TPD. This study sets out to characterize the dynamic of the TPD onset through the monthly monitoring of the dry cut length. This reveals the presence of dry spots on the tapped panel of any trees. The frequency of these dry spots increases dramatically in trees developing high level of TPD. Brown bast is an irreversible form of TPD. Brown bast is correlated to a high level of dry cut length. Application of an intensive harvesting system induces early TPD occurrence, which facilitates the study of TPD. Among latex diagnosis parameters, only sucrose content is significantly associated with TPD. Other parameters are more prone to environmental effects and are not reliable as physiological markers. These findings explain the contradictory conclusions of some papers. This study suggests to use intensive harvesting system and monitor the dry cut length for genetic analysis of TPD.

Abstract: Hevea brasiliensis, a natural rubber producing species, is widely cultivated due to its high rubber yield potential. Natural rubber is synthesised in the rubber particles of laticifers. Latex diagnosis (LD) was established to characterise the physiological state of the laticiferous system by measuring its physiological parameters, i.e., sucrose, inorganic phosphorous (Pi), thiols and total solid content (TSC). Rubber clones are often classified in three groups i.e., quick starters, medium starters and slow starters. To better understand the genetic bases of latex yield, a biparental population was generated from a cross between the quick-starter clone PB 260 and the mediumstarter clone SP 217. LD was performed during the peak latex production season and used to calculate sucrose loading. The agronomic and physiological parameters associated with latex yield led to the classification of genotypes according to the rubber clonal typology and to the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) using a high-density map. Inorganic phosphorous content was positively associated with yield during the first year of production thus enabling identification of quick-starter clones. In addition, the LD-based clonal typology led to determine the long-term yield potential and the use of appropriate ethephon stimulation. QTL analysis successfully identified several QTLs related to yield, sucrose, Pi and TSC. One QTL related to sucrose loading was identified in the same position as the QTL for sucrose on linkage group 1. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report QTL analysis for this trait. The use of a high-density map enables the identification of genes underlying QTLs. Several putative genes underlying QTLs related to yield, sucrose and TSC were identified.

Abstract: CONTEXT: Oil palm smallholders often have difficulty implementing good agricultural practices and replanting, and tend to obtain low yields compared to corporate plantations. A frequent strategy to improve the sustain ability of smallholder production systems is sustainable intensification, aimed at increasing land productivity and farmers' incomes. To facilitate sustainable intensification, many leading public and private sustainability initiatives require farmers to join farmer organisations as a precondition for certification and assistance, with the objective of achieving advantages of scale. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to analyse the resilience of farmer organisations in the Ophir plantation when faced with replanting. We do so by linking actors, situations, and contexts relevant to collective action in five farmer cooperatives in Ophir over a 40-year period. Our aim is to offer unique insights into the enduring dynamics that influence the resilience of farmer organisations, shed light on smallholder oil palm replanting strategies, and draw several key lessons from this case.METHODS: Our findings are based on field visits by the lead author before, during and after replanting. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected to enable a holistic overview. During visits, 110 interviews with relevant stakeholders were recorded, project reports were collected, as were data on yields, costs, and other information on the functioning of the farming system. Analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery of the Ophir plantation and plantation inspections allowed us to further quantify replanting methods and replanting progress. A combined IAD-SES-NAS framework was used to structure findings and link variables, key events and context. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that farmer organisations can facilitate sustainable intensification in smallholder systems, but the resilience of farmer organisations proved diverse during replanting. Thus, farmer organisations are by no means a silver bullet for sustainable intensification. Landscape conditions, palm tree age, smallholder diversity and financial (mis)management play crucial roles in the resilience of farmer organisations and replanting strategies. Significant investment in various types of collective action is needed to encourage sustainable intensification through farmer organisations. SIGNIFICANCE: This article reports a rare holistic analysis of the bio-physical, socio-economic, and institutional aspects impacting collective action and replating in smallholder oil palm plantations. We present significant empirical data, which allows us to link 40 years of interactions between farmers, their institutions, plantations and changing contexts. Thereby we provide unique insights into farmer organisations, collective action and smallholder oil palm replanting.

Abstract: Palm oil has become a leading vegetable oil over the past 30 years and smallholder farmers in Indonesia, with more than 12 million hectare the world's largest producer of palm oil, have massively engaged in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) cultivation. In Sumatra, where more than 60% of Indonesian palm oil is cultivated, smallholders currently cover roughly 50% of the oil palm area. The rapid expansion of palm oil however did not happen without controversy. In current efforts by the Indonesian government, NGO's and private sector to improve sector performance, smallholders are often characterized as the Achilles heel of the oil palm sector due to poor practices and low yields compared to companies. However, 'oil palm smallholders' is a container concept and there has been only limited research into smallholder diversity beyond the organised versus independent farmer dichotomy. This research delves into the implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) among seven types of independent smallholders in Rokan Hulu regency, Riau province. The research area consisted of a relative established agricultural area on mineral soils and a relative frontier, mostly on peat. Smallholder types ranged from small local farmers to large farmers who usually reside in urban areas far from their plantation and regard oil palm cultivation as an investment opportunity. The underlying hypothesis is that larger farmers have more capital and therefore implement better agricultural practices than small farmers, who are usually more cash constrained. A wide range of methods was applied, including farmer and farm surveys, remote sensing, tissue analysis and photo interpretation by experts. These methods provided data on fertilizer use, nutrient conditions in oil palms, planting material, planting patterns, and other management practices in the plantations. Results show that yields are poor, implementation of GAP are limited and there is much room for improvement among all farmer types. Poor planting materials, square planting patterns, and limited nutrient applications were particularly prevalent. This implies that farmers across different typologies opt for a low-input low-output system for a myriad of reasons and that under current conditions, initiatives such as improving access to finance or availability of good planting material alone are unlikely to significantly improve the productivity and sustainability of the smallholder oil palm sector.

Abstract: Latex diagnosis (LD) is applied to optimize the natural rubber production and prevent tapping panel dryness (TPD), a physiological syndrome affecting latex production in Hevea brasiliensis. The reduced thiol content (RSH) is one of the biochemical parameters associated with the risk of TPD. However, RSH is difficult to interpret because of the influence of the environment. In order to better understand the regulation of antioxidants and to better interpret RSH, a key parameter of LD, this study analysed in latex both oxidised and reduced forms of ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione, and their cofactors as well as other latex diagnosis parameters in response to harvesting stress (tapping and ethephon stimulation) and TPD occurrence. The content of antioxidants in latex had a high variability among five rubber clones. The concentration in AsA was about ten times higher than GSH in laticifer, GSH accounting for about 50% of RSH. For short-term harvesting stress, RSH increased with tapping frequency and ethephon stimulation. TPD is associated with high latex viscosity and bursting of lysosomal par-ticles called lutoids, as well as for several rubber clones with lower RSH and GSH contents. These results suggest that a high level of RSH shows the capacity of laticifer metabolism to cope with harvesting stress, while a drop in RSH is the sign of long stress related to lower metabolic activity and TPD occurrence. RSH remains an essential physiological parameter to prevent TPD when associated with reference data under low and high harvesting stress. This study paves the way to understand the role of AsA and GSH, and carry out genetic studies of antioxidants.

Abstract: Cambodia has faced drastic agrarian changes over the last twenty years with a rapid and massive transformation of the uplands from forest into arable land. Soil quality depletion is one of the main drivers of the resulting decline in crop productivity and increasing production costs in the uplands of Battambang province. The objective of the study was to assess the early effects of conventional plough-based (20 cm) management (CT) and two conservation agriculture-based (CA) cropping systems (the use of a single-CAS vs. multiple cover crop species-CAM) on a maize monocropping system using three soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions on Mollisols in Battambang province. SOC content, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) and soil CO2 basal respiration through SituResp (R) were recorded at a depth of 0-10 cm. Twelve sampling periods were used over the growth period of the cover crops and during the maize cycle. POXC and SituResp (R) were highly sensitive to management practices with, across the 12 sampling periods, higher values (p < .05) under CA than CT, with an average increase of 6% and from 20% to 23%, respectively. No difference was observed in SOC content between the practices in our sampling periods. Seasonal variations were observed in both POXC and SituResp<(R)>. POXC underwent larger fluctuations following critical weather events than SituResp (R). This study showed that POXC and SituResp (R) were rapidly sensitive to changes in agricultural management practices. POXC and SituResp (R) are largely influenced by seasonality and could help clarify the impact of weather patterns on soil C dynamics.

Abstract: Beninese smallholders associate food crops and cash crops with immature oil palms to reduce field maintenance costs and gain income before the palms reach productive phase. Little is known about the effects of these crops on the nutritional status and growth of the palms in their immature phase even though the yield of adult palms can be affected by the management practices during this phase. The objective of this study was to evaluate the most common oil palm-based intercropping systems found in southern Benin in terms of nutritional status and growth of the palm. Within 15 oil palm farms, we compared 15 immature oil palm fields where the crop succession associated with the oil palms was dominated by maize, cassava, tomato, and pineapple. The nutrient concentrations in the soil and the palm leaves, and growth indicators were measured at the end of the immature phase. We found that the palm growth indicators were the lowest in the successions with pineapple. N and P nutrition of the immature palms was satisfactory but K was deficient in all systems, especially in those with pineapple. The K levels in the soils and palm leaves were correlated. Rough field budgets comparing the amounts of N and K applied to the crop successions with their N and K exports from non-returning products indicated that soil indigenous K supply would be particularly depleted in the systems with pineapple. We concluded that the young oil palms were affected by the competition for K exerted by the crop successions with pineapple even though they were the most fertilized in the region. The high profitable crop is therefore associated with the lowest growth rates of the immature palms. The mineral fertilizer management in these oil palm temporary intercropping systems should be improved.

Sur le plan m & eacute;thodologique, ces connaissances sont issues de travaux de recherches qui mobilisent le diagnostic agronomique r & eacute;gional et sociotechnique. Dans les syst & egrave;mes traditionnels o & ugrave; des palmiers << tout venant >> sont plant & eacute;s par les propri & eacute;taires terriens pour produire du vin de palme, les m & eacute;tayers augmentent le nombre de cycles de cultures annuelles associ & eacute;es en int & eacute;grant les fertilisations min & eacute;rale et organique & agrave; leurs pratiques.

Agroforestry is a form of agroecological intensification. Farmers in southern Benin are thus innovating in their oil palm groves, to cope with land and food pressures resulting from population growth. In order to support collective action in favor of sustainability, this study aims to identify the levers and constraints to the development of innovations underway in the oil palm groves of southern Benin, based on available knowledge of the socio-technical system, agronomic management and performance achieved. Methodologically, this knowledge is derived from research work involving regional agronomic and socio-technical diagnosis. In traditional systems where oil palms are randomly planted by landowners to produce palm wine, tenants increase the number of annual crop cycles by incorporating mineral and organic fertilization into their practices. In village systems, oil palm growers introduce various annual crops between immature oil palms to meet different objectives depending on the type of operation. The barriers to the development of these innovations are linked to incompatibilities between the visions and innovative strategies of the various stakeholders. In traditional systems, this divergence of vision leads to land conflicts between tenants and landowners, who notice a slowdown in palm growth and break land agreements, assuming that the tenants' practices deplete their soils. In village systems, the technical support provided by research and development actors is focused on prescriptive oil palm cultivation itineraries, while the farmers also need to reason out the fertilization of associated crops. Several perspectives for agroecological intensification are then discussed to support the agroecological transition of the Beninese oil palm sector.

Abstract: Conservation agriculture (CA) is one strategy with which both sustainability and productivity can be achieved by improving soil health. However, linkages between practices, soil health and cropping system performance remain poorly disentangled. We assessed the relationships between soil health and cropping system performance for three maize-based cropping systems in New Caledonia. Two CA systems, one with direct seeding into a mixed species dead mulch (CA-DM) and one into a stylo living mulch (CA-LM), were compared to a conventional tillage (CT) system. CA vs. CT experiment started in 2011, whereas the differentiation between CA-DM and CA-LM was initiated in 2017 only. In 2018, soil health was evaluated using Biofunctool (R), a set of ten in-field tools that assess soil carbon transformation, structure maintenance and nutrient cycling functions. The performance of the three cropping systems were assessed by monitoring weeds, maize growth and yield components. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to disentangle the links between agricultural management, soil health and cropping system performance. Soil structure maintenance and nutrient cycling functions were higher under CA-DM and CA-LM than under CT, and carbon transformation function was higher under CA-DM than under CT and CA-LM. Overall, the soil health index (SHI) was 1.3-fold higher under CA systems than under CT. Cropping system management had both direct and indirect effects on soil functioning and crop productivity leading to a 1.3-fold higher yield under CA than under CT. The direct and indirect effects of CA systems on soil health had positive impacts on ecosystem services (i.e., productivity, weed regulation and soil ecosystem services). Such integrative approaches that account for the relationships and possible trade-offs between cropping system components enable a better understanding of the effects and the performance of practices, and support adaptive agricultural management.

Abstract: Since 2000, farmers in Northeast Thailand have planted more than 5,000 sq km of rubber on land previously devoted to agriculture. The expansion of rubber led to a significant increase in tree cover in Northeast Thailand. Rubber prices peaked in 2011 and since then farmers have had to adjust to lower prices. Little research has documented how farmers responded to low rubber prices. This paper seeks to describe how small-scale rubber farmers use fertilizer in a region that did not historically grow rubber during a period of low rubber prices. We collected data from structured interviews with 29 farmers in Subsomboon village in Khon Kaen province, Northeast Thailand. Most farmers reported that they reduced fertilizer costs by reducing the number of times they applied fertilizer, as well as changing to cheaper brands and/or using organic fertilizer. The majority of farmers still used large amounts of chemical fertilizers, either alone or in combination with commercial organic fertilizers with unknown nutrient contents. The N and P(2)O(5 )contents of the chemical fertilizer alone were consistent with national recommendations (82.0-137.6 kg N/ha/y and 33.3-97.7 kg P2O5/ha/y). Thai national recommendations for rubber, however, were developed for rubber plantations in traditional planting areas where rubber has been grown for over a century, and are considered by many experts to be high. The study's findings indicated that small scale rubber farmers would benefit from recommendations for fertilizer applications that respond to variations in rubber prices, while taking into account the diversity of individual household characteristics and goals. To optimize recommendations that sustain the growth and yield of rubber, limit the effects of environmental externalities, and maintain rubber's profitability, policymakers require detailed information on the diverse situations in which rubber is grown. This requires experimental research that tests a variety of fertilization practices under different biological and physical conditions.

Abstract: Oil palm is a highly potassium (K)-demanding tree requiring fertilisation throughout its life cycle. One of the most common indices to monitor K fertilisation is K content (in % of DW, further noted as %K) in leaflets, typically used in foliar diagnosis (FD). However, uncertainty remains as to whether leaflets are always the most K-responsive organs and furthermore, implementing FD may require separate response curves for different soil and climatic conditions, and newly also i.e. genetic materials (progenies). As such, a universal K indicator ideally responsive to K availability and valid across many progenies could simplify FD. We investigated K responses of oil palm trees in four different progenies grown in North Sumatra, from planting to the maturation stage. Elemental analyses were performed along with biometrical measurements at tree scale, completed by data from agronomic databases. Uni-and multi-variate analyses were performed to identify the best indicators of K response. Tree K balance (difference between K availability and K needs) was computed to determine directly if (i) K supply met tree K demand and (ii) %K in leaflets, rachis or trunk were linked to the K budget. We also interrogate the accuracy of %K expression for K leaf content estimation and answer to it. Standard effects of K availability on height, leaf area, and yield were observed and varied mostly with the progeny. K balance cal-culations showed a systematic K imbalance when bunch production started, suggesting a non-negligible contribution of exchangeable soil K. %K in leaflets, rachis and trunk does not appear to be correlated with K balance. Our work brings out the important result that unlike %K in leaflets, phosphorus (P) and %K in rachis (more precisely %K symbolscript 3 %P) appeared to be tightly correlated with yield (FFB: fresh fruit bunches) two years later, suggesting a possible interdependence between fruits sink force and K-P elemental content in leaves. Since this indicator is under important genetic effect, we propose to use the combination of mineral contents generated by multivariate analysis, which successfully predicts FFB after two years, independently of the progeny.

Abstract: Nutrient management is critical for the development and growth of rubber trees during the immature phase. We present the results of a fertilizer trial during the immature phase of a rubber plantation setup in Cambodia. The main objective of this study was to analyze the response of a specific clone, PB330, in the specific conditions of one of the most important rubber-growing areas of Cambodia. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with 4 treatments and 4 replications. The four treatments consisted of 3 fertilization treatments with an increasing dose of fertilizers (respectively T1, T2 and T3) compared to a non-fertilized control (T0). The girth of trees was measured every six months from the end of the first year after planting (YAP) to the end of the 6th YAP. Results showed that fertilization had a significant effect on tree girth. At the end of the 6th YAP, fertilization had a significant effect on the number of tappable trees, and stand basal area but not on average tree girth. The most pronounced effect of fertilization was observed from annual increments in girth and stand basal area during the 3rd and 4th YAP. The effect of fertilization on tree growth was evident from all three treatments, although T3 gave the most significant increase compared to T0, increasing doses of fertilizer did not significantly improve the growth parameters. Hence, this study confirmed the importance of mineral nutrition on rubber tree growth during the immature phase even at T1, the lowest level of nutrient inputs. These results can be used to improve the standard fertilizer recommendations for immature rubber trees in Cambodia. We recommend setting up similar trials in different edaphic conditions of the country with the aim to establish nutrient management practices tailored to local biophysical constraints.

Abstract: Cereal-legume intercropping has gained increased interest in Europe. Nevertheless, performance and especially the percentage of each species at harvest are often considered highly variable. Nitrogen (N) fertilisation can be a relevant driving factor affecting the percentage of each species at harvest. Soil N availability influences competition for light and nitrogen in cereal-legume intercrops. However, management of N fertilisation still remains unclear for intercrops. Few references on the effects of a range of strategies of N fertilisation are available to guide farmers with relevant decision rules considering their expectations. Here, a modelling approach was proposed to simulate interactions between light and N acquisition of a pea-wheat intercrop and to test different scenarios for the management of such intercrops. A model (Azodyn-IC) was built resulting from the combination of two existing individual-crop models (AZODYN and AFISOL) and by applying rules of light and soil inorganic nitrogen sharing between the intercropped pea and wheat. Evaluation of the model outputs with experimental data showed satisfactory predictions of the studied variables (N accumulation, LAI, and crop dry weight). The model validated both resource sharing and light-N interactions. Furthermore, the model was able to respond to increases in inorganic N availability based upon straightforward formalisms. Simulating unmeasured variables, such as root growth and light interception and use by each species, improved our understanding of the relative dominance of each species for acquiring resources. Eventually, the model was used to simulate different scenarios of N fertilisation over 26 years of climatic data to account for climatic variability. We demonstrated the interest of such a modelling approach to design decision rules of N fertilisation according to farmers' expectations.

Abstract: CONTEXT: Oil palm is widely cultivated in Indonesia and it is produced by various populations of smallholders. Among those, ex-plasma smallholders are characterized by the fact that they only start to manage their own plantations 5 to 10 years after those were initially planted and managed by a partner industrial company. Despite the large areas that are cultivated by ex-plasma smallholders, their diversity of practices and economic performances are poorly quantified. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims at investigating which smallholder farming systems optimize profitability at the plot scale. METHOD: We defined two typologies, one based on agricultural practices and the other based on economic performance, using multivariate statistical analysis. The typologies were crossed to understand the links between agricultural practices and economic performance at the plot level. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that despite initial plot homogeneity during planting phase, ex-plasma smallholders can develop very diversified management practices. A gradient of intensification was observed from farmers implementing no fertilization or weeding management up to farmers following agroindustrial-like management. Economic performances at the plot level was found to be variable, with gross margins ranging from 1.1 to 26.9 M IDR.ha- 1.yr-1 (eq. 66.4 to 1625.5 euro ). We showed that the most intensive practices led to highest yields although these were not linked to the optimal economic plot performances. A trade-off based on input costs was revealed, as high fertilization practices did not seem economically optimal for smallholders. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study highlights the need to combine quantified agronomic assessments with eco-nomic analysis, to properly design recommendations to farmers.

Abstract: Alley cropping agroforestry - whereby tree rows are integrated in crop plots - is considered as a lever for the agroecological transition. Its benefit for enhancing soil functioning is rarely studied. We studied soil health in a 25 years temperate agroforestry plot cultivated with barley (Hordeum vulgare) according to two factors: i. the position to the tree row; and ii. the tree species. Soil health was assessed in three positions (in the tree row; in the crop alley next to the tree row and at 6.5 m from the tree row), for three contrasted tree species (Acer monspessulanum, Fraxinus sp., Pyrus communis) using two integrative methods based on soil biological activity (Biofunctool (R), MicroRespTM). The position factor explained soil health differences the best: mean indexes were found 1.6 times higher in the tree row than in both positions in the crop alley, especially the structure maintenance function was impacted (indexes in the tree row = 0.21 to 0.26; indexes in the crop alley = 0.11 to 0.17). Tree species had less impact on soil health and impacted only carbon dynamics and microbial catabolic profiles. Our study invites to consider spatial organization and tree species to optimize soil ecosystem services in agroforestry systems.

Abstract: Oil palm growth and production is highly dependent on potassium (K) fertilization. Presently, monitoring K fertilization is difficult since it depends on soil properties, crosses and other nutrients. To adjust K fertilization precisely during cultivation, leaf biomarkers that can indicate changes in tree K status before the appearance of symptoms on fruit production and yield, are required. However, the metabolic response of oil palm leaves to K availability is poorly documented. Here, we investigated the response of oil palm leaf metabolome and proteome to K availability in two crosses (Deli x La Me, and Deli x Yangambi) grown in the field. Our result show that one to two years only after the onset of K fertilization treatments, there were changes in N metabolism, photosynthesis and mitochondrial metabolism, with a differential effect in the two crosses. In particular, there were changes in sugars, amino and organic acids pointing to modifications in photosynthetic and catabolic (Krebs cycle) capacity and this agreed with the effect seen on enzyme content. Therefore, K availability led to rapid changes in leaf primary metabolism, opening avenues for the utilization of leaf metabolic signature as a marker of K nutrition in oil palm.

Abstract: Potassium fertilization is commonly practiced in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations to increase yield. However, its effects on fruit oil content and composition are not well documented. Here, we conducted bunch, metabolomics, and oil composition analyses in two contrasting crosses (Deli x La Me and Deli x Yangambi) grown under different K fertilization conditions. K availability impacted bunch oil content, resulting in lower water content and higher oil proportion in fruit mesocarp, in Deli x La Me only, thus showing differential responses of crosses to K. Oil composition at maturity did not significantly change under low K conditions despite clear alterations in fruit metabolism associated with lipid production during maturation, demonstrating the resilience of oil biosynthetic metabolism. However, the analysis of variance in oil content (across K treatments and crosses) demonstrates that sugar availability, lipid synthesis rates, and metabolic recycling are all important in determining the oil content.

Abstract: A soil chemical quality index is designed for cacao production systems. It is based on worldwide scientific knowledge and built using data from three municipalities of Tolima department in Colombia. Fuzzy logic is used in a multicriteria decision making framework in two different ways. First, fuzzy sets are used to model an expert preference relation for each of the individual information sources to turn raw data into satisfaction degrees. Second, fuzzy rules are used to model the interaction between sources to aggregate the individual degrees into a global score. The whole framework is implemented as an open source software called GeoFIS. A part of the data was used for calibration, then the remaining data served as a validation set. The results were easy to analyze and in agreement with field observations. The output inferred by the fuzzy inference system was used as a target to learn the weights of classical numerical aggregation operators. Only the Choquet Integral proved to have a similar modeling ability, but its optimal tuning would have been difficult without learning.

Abstract: Tree crop growers are particularly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations. Since 2012, rubber prices have been decreasing. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of how Thai family farms responded to that continuous decrease in rubber prices. The originality of this work was to combine a farming system approach for decision making with the sustainable rural livelihoods' framework for resource endowment and strategies to benefit from the complementarities of these two theoretical approaches. An existing database was used characterizing the rubber farms and farmers' practices in 2011 when the rubber price was at its maximum. A subsample of farmers was interviewed again in 2017 after six years of price decreases to characterize the new situation and to identify and explain the changes. Fifteen flexibility mechanisms to face the crisis were implemented at three different levels: rubber cropping system, farming system and activity system. Combinations of these mechanisms identified eight strategies of adaptation to the crisis, classified on the reversibility of the changes. Three major types of strategies were identified: (i) reversible adjustments at the level of activity system variables, (ii) mobilization of available production factors to be invested in an activity that allows, over a longer time perspective, compensation for the disturbances caused by the crisis. This type of adaptation was reversible, but its implementation expressed motivation in the medium and long terms; (iii) reallocation of the production factors already mobilized at the level of the rubber cropping system toward other activities, to compensate the disturbances caused by the crisis. This last type induced a deeper transformation in the distribution of the production factors in the activity system and was anchored in a long-term vision. The first type corresponded to a dynamics of disturbances absorption to maintain the smallholders' systems and overcome the crisis; the two other types corresponded to dynamics of compensation with more or less reversible changes. Overall, this study confirmed the capacity of adaptation of family agriculture when facing shocks. It also showed that the flexibility of these households relied greatly on rubber cropping systems through possible technical change and through the adaptation of the share-tapping labor contract. This highlighted the importance of considering farmers' practices (and changes of practices) to understand their strategies.

Abstract: The coagula derived from Hevea latex are the main raw material for block natural rubber production, especially for the two most commercialized grades (TSR10 and TSR20). The properties and mesostructure of dry natural rubber depend on several factors during coagula maturation. This work investigated an experimental design allowing concomitant control of several factors during maturation of cup coagula, namely, temperature, relative humidity, atmosphere, vertical weight, coagulation conditions, clone, and maturation duration. For each combination of factors, several indicators were measured. They dealt with the coagula (thickness, DRCcoag), with the dry rubber (physical properties (P-0, PRI, ASHT), and the mesostructure (Gel(>1 mu), M-n, M-w, M-z). Statistical treatment of the results (recursive partition) led to a hierarchical ranking of factors for each measured indicator. The first-ranked parameter was coagulation mode followed by genotype (clone) or maturation duration, temperature, or weight application. The provided identification of the most important drivers occurring during coagula maturation could allow improvements of the post-harvest operational handling aiming at a better control of the variability of produced natural rubber properties.

Abstract: The evolution of the mesostructure (structuring dynamics) of natural rubber (NR) during maturation after different modes of coagulation is poorly known, especially inside wet coagula. Therefore, coagula made from 3 different coagulation modes (sulfuric acid, formic acid, and natural coagulations) with different maturation durations (0, 2, 9, 16, 30, and 44 days) were studied. The mesostructure of NR samples was analyzed using SEC-MALS on wet coagula and on wet and dry crepes. For wet coagula coagulated with acids, only Mz and Mw decreased slightly with maturation time, while Mn and Gel>1 mu had no significant evolution during maturation. On the other hand, for wet coagula after natural coagulation, all mesostructure indicators evolved significantly with maturation time. The results showed that structuration increased along maturation time, generating microaggregates with larger size and more structured macrogel inside wet coagula after natural coagulation. This study found that creping process (comparison of wet coagula and wet crepes) had only a moderate effect on the structuration of NR samples. However, the drying process (comparison of wet and dry crepes) had an important effect on the structuration of rubber, especially for natural coagulation and formic acid coagulation. Coagulation with sulfuric acid appeared to slow down the phenomena related to the structuration of microaggregates and macrogel.

Abstract: Oil palm is presently the most important oil-producing crop worldwide in terms of oil production and consumption. However, oil palm cultivation faces important challenges such as adverse climatic conditions, expensive fertilization requirements, and fungal pathogens, including Ganoderma. Intense efforts in oil palm breeding are devoted to improving both oil production yield and resistance to environmental cues. Metabolomics can be of interest because it provides many quantitative traits and metabolic signatures that can be selected for to optimize oil palm performance. Here, we briefly review how metabolomics can help oil palm breeding, and to do so, we give examples of recent metabolomics analyses and provide a roadmap to use metabolomics-assisted breeding.

Abstract: The rise of palm oil as the world's most consumed vegetable oil has coincided with exponential growth in palm oil research activity. Bibliometric analysis of research outputs reveals a distinct imbalance in the type of research being undertaken, notably a disproportionate focus on biofuel and engineering topics. Recognizing the expansion of oil palm agriculture across the tropics and the increasing awareness of environmental, social, and economic impacts, we seek to reorientate the existing research agenda toward one that addresses the most fundamental and urgent questions defined by the palm oil stakeholder community. Following consultation with 659 stakeholders from 38 countries, including palm oil growers, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and researchers, the highest priority research questions were identified within 13 themes. The resulting 279 questions, including 26 ranked as top priority, reveal a diversity of environmental and social research challenges facing the industry, ranging from the ecological and ecosystem impacts of production, to the livelihoods of plantation workers and smallholder communities. Analysis of the knowledge type produced from these questions underscores a clear need for fundamental science programmes, and studies that involve the consultation of non-academic stakeholders to develop "transformative" solutions to the oil palm sector. Stakeholders weremost aligned in their choice of priority questions across the themes of policy and certification related themes, and differed the most in environmental feedback, technology and smallholder related themes. Our recommendations include improved regional academic leadership and coordination, greater engagement with private and public stakeholders in Africa, and Central and South America, and enhanced collaborative efforts with researchers in the major consuming countries of India and China.

Abstract: Natural rubber consumption has led to the expansion of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations which affects the deforestation and ecosystem. However, no study of the long-term effect of rubber plantations on soil biodiversity has been carried out yet. This study aimed to assess the long-term impact of continuous rubber monocropping on soil biodiversity, focusing on soil macrofauna and nematode diversity. Three successive rubber rotations at young and old ages were compared with the adjacent forest in Suratthani province, Thailand. Soil biodiversity quality index was calculated from a set of indicators which were combined into a single score to present a functional assessment of the gradient of disturbance. The results showed three negative effects on soil biodiversity (i) the biodiversity quality index immediately declined after deforestation (ii) the old age rubber plantations had a lower soil biodiversity as the nematodes were a main driver of diversity in the young plantation, and (iii) similarly, for the soil chemical properties, the long-term effect of rubber chronosequence evidenced deterioration in the third rotation. Therefore, two rotations of rubber plantation (around 50 years) seemed to be the maximum length of rubber monocropping in terms of soil biodiversity recovery.

Abstract: Rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis) cover large areas in the tropics. In historical producing regions like South Thailand, rubber has been planted by smallholders for three successive rotations lasting a total of 75 years. Despite possible consequences on topsoil, the long-term impacts of repeated rubber plantations on soil quality remain unknown. This study aims to better understand how various factors linked to long-term rubber land use and land use change affect topsoil physico-chemical properties and soil organic carbon (SOC) thermal stability. We focus on the effects of three factors: i. deforestation (change from forest to first rubber plantation); ii. the age of the rubber stand (immature vs. mature); and iii. long-term rubber cultivation (first, second or third successive rotation) over a chronosequence in farmers plots. Our results show that soil was deeply degraded after deforestation to a rubber plantation. Long-term rubber cultivation is also detrimental for the soil and has a more negative impact on soil physico-chemical properties and carbon dynamics, than the age of the rubber stand (e.g., on average, decrease of 50% of SOC content between forest and third rotation). At the third rotation, after 50 years of rubber cultivation, the quality of the 0-10 cm soil layer was very low, with an increase in SOC thermal stability. At this stage, logging practices upset the sustainability of the system. These impacts could be limited by less destructive practices during planting.

Abstract: Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is currently cultivated on 19 million ha, and palm oil represents more than one-third of the global vegetable oil market. Addition of nitrogen (N) via legume cover crop and fertilizers is a common practice in industrial oil palm plantations, however, there is a tendency for N loss, thus contributing significantly to environmental effects. To improve the sustainability of palm oil production, it is crucial to determine which management practices minimize N losses. Continuous field measurements would be cost-prohibiting as a monitoring tool, and in the case of oil palm, available models do not account for all the potential nitrogen inputs and losses or management practices. In this context, we developed IN-Palm, a model to help managers and scientists estimate N losses to the environment and identify best management practices. The main challenge was to build the model in a context of knowledge scarcity. Given these objectives and constraints, we developed an agri-environmental indicator, using the INDIGO method and fuzzy decision trees. We validated the N leaching module of IN-Palm against field data from Sumatra, Indonesia. IN-Palm is implemented in an Excel file and uses 21 readily available input variables to compute 17 modules. It estimates annual emissions and scores for each N-loss pathway and provides recommendations to reduce N losses. IN-Palm predictions of N leaching were acceptable according to several statistics, with a tendency to underestimate nitrogen leaching. Thus, we highlighted necessary improvements to increase IN-Palm precision before use in plantations.

Abstract: Purpose Spatially explicit freshwater eutrophication indicators in life cycle assessment focus on phosphorus as the sole contributor to such impacts. Nitrogen may also be an ecological limiting factor in freshwater systems, but commonly not modelled. This work aims at filling this gap by consistently developing fate factors (FFs) for both dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), using the same underlying model of nutrient export by rivers. Methods The present FFs were developed for application to both diffuse emissions from soil and point emissions of nutrients to freshwater. The fate processes modelled include nutrient attenuation from land to stream, in the river network, in artificial reservoirs and lakes and associated with water consumption. FFs were calculated at a river basin resolution with a global coverage and at the country and global scales by means of emission-weighting aggregation and distinguishing agricultural from non-agricultural emissions. Results and discussion River basin-scale FFs range from 7.7 x 10(-8) to 330 days for N emissions and from 3.0 x 10(-8) to 520 days for P emissions. Fate factors are aggregated at country and global scale with applicability at such scales in mind. Global average FFs (in days) are FFsoil Nglobal = 125; FFfw N global = 257; FFsoil P global = 23; FFfw P global = 247. Comparison of FFs calculated at various scales showed the importance of using FFs at the highest spatial resolution (i.e. river basin). However, the river basin resolution may be too coarse for certain large basins as demonstrated for the Waikato basin in New Zealand, where FFs calculated at the sub-basin scale varied significantly. The characterisation factors represent the potential contribution of N and P to freshwater eutrophication (in N-eq and P-eq). The N and P components can be aggregated into a single indicator expressed in "algae-equivalent" for co-limited catchments or when the limitation status is unknown. The present fate model for freshwater eutrophication is consistent with and complements recent advances in marine eutrophication impact assessment. Conclusion Applying these FFs in conjunction with a spatially explicit inventory data of N and P emissions may improve the environmental relevance of freshwater eutrophication impact assessment in LCA. One limitation is the focus on dissolved N and P, as highlighted by a comparison of attenuation factors with a New Zealand-specific hydrological model. The inclusion of particulate and organic N and P from NEWS2 should be part of future freshwater eutrophication FF developments.

Abstract: Objective: Beef production in the Lake Taupo region of New Zealand (NZ) is regulated for nitrogen (N) leaching. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the implications of nitrogen emission limitations on eutrophication and climate change impacts of NZ beef through its life cycle to a European market and uniquely link it to 2) estimation of the reduction in these impacts that can be funded by the consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for a low environmental-impact product. Method: The cradle-to-market Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of NZ beef on the European market included beef production on farms, meat processing, packaging and transport stages. Various beef production systems in the Lake Taupd region were modelled: farm systems with and without regulated N leaching limits in place (using N fertiliser inputs of 0 and 100 kg N/ha/year respectively) using suckler beef or beef derived from surplus calves from a dairy farm. The FARMAX model was used to model farm productivity and profitability under these various scenarios, whereas the OVERSEER (R) model was used to model field/farm emissions (N, phosphorus (P)) and the NZ greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventory model was used to estimate total GHG emissions. Eutrophication and climate change impacts of NZ beef to the European market were calculated using recent regionalised LCA indicators. We estimated freshwater and marine eutrophication impacts of European beef using published N emissions to water and air. We estimated the European consumer's WTP for beef with positive environmental attributes based on a meta-regression analysis based on 21 published studies and compared farmer's profit for the farm system scenarios. Results: When using common P-driven eutrophication indicators, the farms using 100 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year appeared to have a lower freshwater eutrophication impact than farms using no N fertiliser, which is in contradiction with the local freshwater policy for N regulations. When the contribution of both N and P were accounted for, the farms using no N fertiliser had the lowest estimated impact Comparison with published environmental footprint of beef from Europe showed lower climate change and eutrophication impacts for NZ beef, thus showing potential positive environmental attributes for NZ beef. The European consumer's WIP (32% price premium) for such a beef product with low environmental impacts could offset the cost to farmers for implementing the reduction of N emissions. Conclusions: Bridging the gap between local freshwater policy and LCA indicators starts by considering both P and N emissions and impacts. Combining an environmental LCA with an economic analysis revealed that the consumer willingness to pay could compensate for the environmental cost of protecting the lake that currently only the farmers are bearing.

Abstract: The study took place in southern Thailand, in Phatthalung province, and is part of "Heveadapt," a Franco-Thai research project. The aim of this project was to show how smallholder rubber plantations can adapt and remain sustainable in the face of variable climatic conditions and deep changes in socio-economic context. Among the various types of cropping systems, agroforestry practices were identified as promising. Rubber agroforestry systems (AFS) are economically more productive than rubber monocrop plantations and give more flexibility to smallholders, in particular when rubber prices are low, which has been the case since 2013. However, adoption of AFS during the mature period of the plantations is very low in Thailand. The policy to boost rubber agroforestry practices still needs to be developed with all local stakeholders. The objectives of the study were to identify the possibilities and capacities to use current AFS dynamic networks as a basis to set up a rubber agroforestry innovation platform. The research team studied: i) farmers' collective organizations, groups or networks with rubber AFS partially or entirely and ii) the social dynamic enabling the sharing of knowledge and know-how. An individual producer's grid, with original farmers or strong knowledge with ease of sharing, was also studied. The role of local institutions involved in the promotion of rubber AFS was also analyzed. This allowed us to design an innovation platform and to define activities that suit the socio-economic context of Phatthalung province. The main aims of the platform are to promote cooperation among innovative producers and the transmission between them of knowledge and know-how about rubber AFS. This could an efficient tool that Thai rubber institutions could set up to encourage the adoption of rubber AFS by farmers.

Abstract: Global environmental degradation, and the diverse and intense interactions between irrigation and the environment, are prompting the sector to play a more active role towards sustainability. This paper builds on ICID's 2030 vision on a more sustainable irrigation sector. It recaps the various environmental impacts of irrigation systems and calls for a threefold paradigm shift: the objectives of irrigation, its practices, and the ways to assess its impacts must evolve. The paper critically analyses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs') framework, which provides a prompting set of orientations, yet with little consideration of the systemic nature of irrigation. The paper promotes more operational frameworks: nexus thinking and the ecosystem services' framework, since both allow for systemic approaches, and for developing trade-offs. The paper also discusses the merits of life cycle analysis (LCA) for environmental impact assessment. The benefits gained through these alternative approaches are illustrated in two cases of environmental impacts: return flow and salinization. Finally, the paper suggests combining these approaches with three principles for fostering a true paradigm shift in agricultural water use: developing and using suitable metrics, combining models to reconnect economic concerns with environmental ones, and considering larger territories and ecosystems to cater for interactions with the environment.

Abstract: Soil health is defined as the soil's capacity to deliver ecosystem functions within environmental constraints. On tree plantations, clear-cutting and land preparation between two crop cycles cause severe physical disturbances to the soil and seriously deplete soil organic carbon and biodiversity. Rubber, one of the main tropical perennial crops worldwide, has a plantation life cycle of 25 to 40 years, with successive replanting cycles on the same plot. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of clear-cutting disturbance on three soil functions (carbon transformation, nutrient cycling and structure maintenance) and their restoration after the planting of the new rubber crop, in two contrasting soil situations (Arenosol and Ferralsol) in Cote d'Ivoire. In this 18-month diachronic study, we intensively measured soil functions under different scenarios as regards the management of logging residues and the use or not of a legume cover crop. We investigated the relationship between soil macrofauna diversity and soil heath. At both sites, clear-cutting and land preparation disturbed carbon transformation and nutrient cycling significantly and, to a lesser extent, structure maintenance function. When logging residues were applied, carbon transformation and structure maintenance functions were fully restored within 12 to 18 months after disturbance. By contrast, no restoration of nutrient cycling was observed over the study period. A legume cover crop mainly improved the restoration of carbon transformation. We found a strong relationship (P <= 0.001; R-2 = 0.62-0.66) between soil macrofauna diversity and soil health. Our overall results were very similar at the two sites, despite their contrasting soil conditions. Keeping logging residues in the plots and sowing a legume in the inter-row at replanting accelerated the restoration of soil functions after major disturbance caused by clear-cutting and land preparation. Our results confirm the necessity of taking soil macrofauna diversity into account in the management of tropical perennial crops. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Soil erosion on agricultural land is a major threat for food and raw materials production. It has become a major concern in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations introduced on sloping ground. Alternative agroecological crop management practices must be investigated. One aim of our study was to assess the ability of logging residues (i. e., trunks, branches, leaves and stumps of a clearcut plantation) and of legume cover (Pueraria phaseoloides) to mitigate N, P and K losses through runoff and soil detachment in a young rubber plantation. The other aim was to investigate the relationships of these nutrient losses with soil structure and soil macrofauna diversity. Runoff and soil loss were monitored for 3 years using 1-m2 plots under different practices as regards the management of logging residues and the use or not of a legume. The monitoring started when rubber trees were one-year-old. The planting row, where soil was bare, was the hotspot of soil erosion, with an average runoff of 832 mm y-1 and soil loss of 3.2 kg m- 2 y-1. Sowing a legume in the inter -row reduced runoff and soil loss by 88 % and 98 % respectively, compared to bare soil. Spreading logging residues as well as growing a legume cover almost eliminated runoff and soil detachment (19 mm y-1 and 4 g m- 2 y-1 respectively). Nutrient losses were negligible as long as the soil surface was covered by a legume crop, with or without logging residues. Total N loss from soil detachment ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 g m- 2 y-1, for example. Spreading logging residues in the inter -rows significantly improved soil structure and soil macrofauna diversity compared to bare soil. Nutrient losses from runoff and soil detachment were negatively correlated with improved soil structure and soil macrofauna diversity. We recommend investigating alternative ways to manage planting rows.

Abstract: Rubber trees are the main source of natural rubber (NR). The area occupied by rubber plantations rose from 3.9 million ha in 1961 to 12.5 million ha in 2018. Both the expansion of rubber plantations in marginal zones (prone to biotic and abiotic stress), and long-term rubber tree cultivation in traditional areas, raise questions about the sustainability of NR production in a context of climate change. Our study set out to gain insights into the biogeochemical cycles in rubber plantations, for a better matching of fertilizer inputs to the dynamics of nutrient demand throughout rubber tree growth. Nutrient accumulation in tree biomass is a major component of the biological cycle in tree plantations. We studied the dynamics of biomass and nutrient accumulation in two chronosequences covering the whole lifespan of a plantation in Ivory Coast managed on a sandy soil at the SAPH site, and one on a clayey soil at the SOGB site. In total, 56 trees were destructively sampled in 2-, 5-, 20- and roughly 40-year-old stands. While the use of allometric relationships is common for estimating nutrient stocks in planted forests, this study was the first to provide allometric equations predicting nutrient stocks in rubber tree components. Allometric models were applied to the inventory of 4 commercial stands, for each age at each site, to estimate stand biomass and nutrient stocks. The current annual increments of nutrient stocks in tree biomass peaked between 2 and 5 years after planting. They reached 80 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for N, 14 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for P and 34 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for K at SAPH (53, 7, and 39 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively at SOGB), which highlighted the importance of an appropriate fertilization schedule for young rubber trees. At the clear-cut age (38-40 years), the amounts of nutrients accumulated in tree biomass were 970 kg N ha(-1), 188 kg P ha(-1), 366 kg K ha(-1), 941 kg Ca ha(-1) and 255 kg Mg ha(-1) on the sandy soil at SAPH (907,118, 629 1499, and 375 kg ha(-1) respectively on the clayey soil at SOGB). Contrasting soil properties and management practices at the two sites had a much greater effect on the amounts of P, K, Ca and Mg accumulated in the trees than on N accumulation. Logging practices in rubber plantations can lead to considerable nutrient exports on poor tropical soils. Harvest residues should be distributed uniformly in the plots so that the roots of young trees can quickly gain access to the nutrients released during decomposition.

Abstract: As a response to the worldwide challenge raised by soil degradation, Conservation Agriculture (CA) was proposed to help restoring the three main soil functions, i.e. carbon transformation, nutrient cycling and structure maintenance. However, there is still a lack of integrative studies that assess the overall impact of CA on soil health. To fill the gap, Biofunctooll (R), a set of in-field indicators, was developed to monitor changes in soil biological functioning. In this study, Biofunctool (R) was used to assess the impact of a conventional tillage (CT) and three CA annual-based cropping systems on soil health on a Cambodian Oxisol. Eight indicators related to the three soil functions were monitored and integrated into a Soil Quality index (SQI), i.e. the Biofunctool (R) Index. Overall, we found that soil health was twice higher under the CA treatments than under CT treatment. Although it was similar in the three CA treatments, the contribution of each soil function to the soil health diverged. An analysis of soil carbon dynamics also showed that CA support short-term soil organic carbon stabilization compared to CT. This study demonstrates that Biofunctool (R) is a robust, relevant, time-and cost-effective in-field assessment tool that can be used in multiple ways including cropping system management, capacity building of local stakeholders, and policy dialogue.

Abstract: TRAILS stands for "climaTe Resilient lAndscapes for wIldLife conServation"; it is a multidisciplinary research project aimed at assessing innovative solutions for wildlife and people in oil palm-dominated landscapes in Sabah, Borneo Island, Malaysia. Mixed-tree forests can provide habitat in a context of industrial agriculture, as pioneer tree species are efficient in restoring healthy riparian forests and providing shelter for wildlife. Biodiversity corridors also contribute to climatic resilience, as agroforestry systems can mitigate climate change through the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in plants and soil. Mixed plantations also improve livelihoods: it is key to understand ecosystems services and wellbeing values attributed by local communities to the reforestation of riparian areas and the transition from monoculture plantations toward mixed-planted systems. TRAILS objective is to install oil-palm-based agroforestry systems, using selected oil palm seedlings and native forest tree species grown in locally run village nurseries. The project also aims at monitoring the dynamics of recolonization by wildlife in areas covered with mixedplanting, riparian corridors, and oil palm plantations. The project monitors the agronomic performance of oil palms planted under agroforestry designs. TRAILS also aims at understanding key characters of climate resilience through the monitoring of bioclimatic condition of the parcels and their ability to provide environmental services. TRAILS builds on a complementary partnership, linking academic, NGOs, private and public stakeholders, thus enabling integrated approaches arising from various science fields, from agronomy and forestry to veterinary sciences, including a detailed socioeconomic approach.

Abstract: The future of most tropical sectors is clouded by growing constraints linked to, among many other parameters, climate change, price volatility and labour scarcity. Perpetuating agricultural systems inherited from the colonial era (a time of abundant arable land, protected markets, and cheap and disciplined labour) will not be enough to prepare these sectors in facing immediate crucial challenges unless substantial structural transformations are made.Implementing a successful agroecological transition in a 70-billion USD sector, covering 25 million ha worldwide, calls for drastic changes in mind-sets and practices. The key issue is no longer simply to increase productivity, but to foster innovations designed to support endangered tropical biodiversity, while providing a decent living for shrinking agricultural communities in the Global South.Agroforestry practices have a role to play in providing substantial climate change mitigation with an impact comparable to other climate-focused solutions, such as reforestation. The expected contribution of oil palm-based agroforestry relies on agro-environmental services, as basic agricultural functions such as soil preservation, pollination, or pest control can be ensured by living organisms inside and around the plantation. Diversified systems are able to achieve both economic and environmental gains, as they use land more efficiently than monocultures. Building on regenerative agriculture, new plantation designs are emerging and deserve to be thoroughly assessed to establish evidence-based advocacy for change.

Abstract: Areas identified as escape zones for Pseudocercospora ulei, the causal agent of South American Leaf Blight (SALB), are being sought for the development of profitable rubber growing, as high-yielding Asian clones can be grown there without suffering repeated defoliation caused by epidemics of the disease. A performance trial with 10 clones was set up in 2006 in such an escape zone in Ecuador with non-American clones whose high production potential is acknowledged elsewhere in the world, some of which are recommended on a commercial scale. Production results over seven years, between 2013 and 2019, indicated a very high potential for this material in this new region, reaching average yields of 2.5 t/ha/year for clones PB 280, PB 312 and PB 314, and 1.85 t/ha/year for the control clone RRIM 600, despite a very pronounced 5-month dry season. However, the risks of wind damage and tapping panel dryness were found to be very high for PB 312 and PB 314. Clone PB 280 proved to perform best overall, with 93% of trees in production and one of the lowest Tapping Panel Dryness (TPD) rates. This clone, distinguished by its medium high latex metabolism and a high sucrose reserve, presents a highly promising alternative for the cultivation of rubber trees in escape zones. This is particularly relevant in situations where the phytosanitary risk associated with P. ulei is constrained.

Abstract: Perennial cropping systems begin their cycles with a pluriannual immature period. Appropriate management, including the inter-rows, is essential for the long-term viability, and productivity of the plantation while reducing the length of the unproductive period. Despite its significant economic and environmental impacts, the immature period is still poorly characterized and rarely included in the assessment of perennial cropping systems sustainability. Rubber plantations are an interesting case, as a major perennial system in the tropics. Here we conducted a systematic review to identify (1) management practices in inter-rows of immature rubber plantations; (2) the variables used in the literature to analyze the adoption drivers of these practices and to assess their effects on plantation functionalities and performances; and (3) the main effects of diversification practices on plantation functionalities and performances. The major results showed that (1) different inter-row management practices, including a diversity of crops, are possible during the immature period; (2) adoption of diversification practices is driven by few global factors but mostly depends on the specific socio-economic and agroecological context; (3) diversification practices are usually assessed with respect to agronomic and economic performances, and their impacts are generally positive. We identified missing knowledge required for a comprehensive view on current inter-row management practices in immature rubber plantations. First, technical operations should be included in the characterization and assessment of inter-row management practices. Second, a multicriteria assessment framework is required to cover all the sustainability dimensions to guarantee the diffusion of more performant management practices. In order to include the diversity of perceptions of sustainability in rubber plantations, this multicriteria assessment should be based on relevant criteria that combine farmers' and scientists' points of view. Detailed characterization of current immature rubber plantations merged with multicriteria assessment will be essential for the design of more sustainable rubber tree cropping systems.

Abstract: The concepts of soil security (especially relating to soil condition) provide a useful framework in building spectral libraries. Spectral libraries can be used with the purpose of assessing soil condition by measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) or increasing productivity through soil nutrient management. A spectral library was generated by measuring SOC and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) and spectral reflectance data over the visible to near-infrared range (350-2,500 nm) in soil samples collected from four production systems in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The spectral library was analysed using SpecOptim, a software tool developed at the James Hutton Institute to explore spectral pre-processing and calibration options. From 192 model combinations of model, the best one was identified for each study area. Different combinations of data were also explored (e.g. by farm or all together). We believe that at the local-scale, soil carbon and nitrogen variability can be captured; however, the spectrally inactive properties such as phosphorous and potassium need to have a higher variability and therefore pooling is required in order to predict properties chemometrically. The SpecOptim software is a useful tool where analysis of spectral data can be difficult to determine. Specifically, it helped improve the accuracy of predictions by 2% for C and N (except for East New Britain site) compared with previously used pre-processing techniques and calibration models while automating identification of the optimal pre-processing approach. We believe that we have developed research-based evidence for using spectral libraries to fit with the soil priority areas of PNG.

Abstract: Cocoa is among the most desirable and palatable food in the world. Soil under cacao trees in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is fertile, however, it's been identified that to sustainably reach a production goal of 310,000 t by 2030, PNG needs soil-based recommendations. For this purpose, a cost-effective, rapid and non-invasive soil testing approach using near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (NIR-DRS), to cater for soil testing needs of numerous small landholdings was assessed. This study investigated whether spectral data collected from smallholder farms across provinces can be used to estimate soil conditions for cacao farming. To assess this, a spectral library was generated by measuring 17 different soil parameters and spectral reflectance data over visible to near-infrared region (350-2500 nm) in 507 soil samples collected from four production systems in Autonomous region of Bougainville (AroB), New Ireland province (NIP), East New Britain province (ENB) and East Sepik province (ESP). Analysis of spectral data showed that the shallow limestone soil of NIP is dominantly montmorillonite mixed with kaolinite clay minerals, while the three other sampling sites are mostly vermiculite with mixed illite type of clay. Among Cubist, partial-least-square regression (PLSR), and support vector regression (SVR) chemometric approaches, Cubist model outperformed both SVR and PLSR. Most soil properties were estimated with high accuracy (concordance coefficient >= 0.7) using the Cubist model, except for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), available K and B. The high quality of the prediction models maybe owing to the variability in properties of the four different soils captured through conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. Results from this study also suggest that soil samples collected from multiple depths may be used for predicting both surface (0-30 cm) and sub-surface (30-90 cm) soil properties. Thus, this tool can help reduce the cost of laboratory analysis, even if it requires analysis of samples for calibration for the development of a successful spectral library across provinces.

Abstract: In this study, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) approach was examined for making input recommendations in the smallholder cocoa farms of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Soil samples were collected from four provinces of PNG. Soil samples from four different depths (0-10, 10-30, 30-60 and 60-90 cm) of 32 profiles in each of these site were used to create a database of soil chemical and physical properties. Spectral reflectance values at 1 nm interval covering visible to shortwave-infrared (350-2,500 nm) were collected for each of these soil samples to develop partial least squares regression models. Soil textural fractions, soil organic carbon contents and available N were well predicted by the DRS approach with R-2 values larger than 0.75. Moderate to poor estimation efficiencies were observed for remaining parameters. Nevertheless, the estimated soil attributes and their corresponding measured soil parameters were used as inputs to an input recommendation model of soil diagnosis to create input recommendation for a targeted cocoa yield of 1,000 kg dry cocoa beans ha(-1) Resulting input recommendations were similar for both of these input sources (measured and DRS-estimated) suggesting that the DRS approach may provide an easy way to create input recommendations.

Abstract: Biofunctool (R) is a new framework for assessing the impact of land management on soil quality - defined as the capacity of the soil to function. Biofunctool (R). uses a set of twelve indicators to monitor changes in three key soil functions: carbon transformation, nutrient cycling and structure maintenance (part A). Information from all the indicators is integrated in a Soil Quality Index using multivariate analysis (PCA) weighting. We used Biofunctool (R) to assess the impact of land use, land use change and agricultural practices on soil quality. The Biofunctool (R) index was measured for soils in Thailand within rubber plantations, forests and intensive cash crops (cassava and sugar cane). The results demonstrate that the Biofunctool (R) index provides an aggregated synthetic soil functioning score that is sensitive to land management and is robust in various pedo-climatic contexts. Firstly, the index revealed the impact on soil of land conversion from annual cropping to rubber plantations and ranked the effect on soil with respect to a natural forest reference. Secondly, it showed the positive effect of legume cover-crops on soil functioning. Thirdly, it highlighted a trend of improving soil quality with increasing age of rubber plantations, in contrasted pedo-climatic contexts. It is concluded that the Biofunctool (R) index is a reliable and relevant descriptor of integrated soil functioning (i.e. soil quality) that could be useful for environmental impact assessment at regional to global scales.

Abstract: The assessment of soil quality is a scientific issue that has been widely debated in the literature for the last twenty years. We developed the Biofunctool (R) framework to assess soil quality based on an integrative approach that accounts for the link between the physico-chemical properties and the biological activity of soils. Biofunctool (R) consists in a set of twelve in-field, time- and cost-effective indicators to assess three main soil functions: carbon transformation, nutrient cycling and structure maintenance. The indicators were applied in a network of mostly rubber plantations compared with three other land uses in Thailand. We collected 1952 indicators values in 180 sampling points over a wide range of pedo-climatic and agronomic contexts in order to assess the validity of the indicators. A reliability, redundancy and sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the capacity of the set of indicators to assess the impact of land management on soil quality. The results showed the relevance and consistence of each of the twelve indicators to assess the soil functioning. Improvements are finally discussed to guide further implementation of the indicators in various contexts and build a soil quality index.

Abstract: The assessment of the impacts of land-use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics is a major environmental concern, as the soil carbon cycle underpins key ecosystem services. However, assessments based on short-term SOC dynamics face methodological and experimental difficulties. Hurisso et al. (2016) proposed a method to assess SOC dynamics by coupling two methods: Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon (POXC) and Basal Soil Respiration (BSR). This method has been used in laboratory on dried and re-wetted soil samples from temperate regions mainly. In our study, we adapted this method to the field and proposed a cost-effective in-field indicator combining the POXC and in situ Basal Soil Respiration (SituResp (R) method). We tested the indicator at four study sites (n = 169 points) within various tropical land-use and management contexts based on rubber, soybean and oil palm cropping systems respectively in Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The results demonstrated the relevance, sensitivity and robustness of the POXC-SituResp (R) indicator to characterize the impact of a gradient of disturbance on SOC dynamics. The results also highlighted the potential of conservation agriculture (no-tillage and crops residues) and compost amendments to accumulate SOC. Rock-Eval (R) analysis showed that POXC-SituResp (R) indicator is negatively linked to excess of potentially mineralizable labile carbon. Carbon pools targeted by the POXC were specified by Rock-Eval (R) pyrolysis measurements to be a rather thermal resistant pool of SOC. Our study confirms that the integrated indicator based on POXC and BSR assess a relative carbon stabilization of SOC pools. This indicator can be measured in the field by a rapid and cost-effective method.

Abstract: CONTEXT: Smallholders play a considerable role in oil palm production in Indonesia. Their specific constraints lead to contrasted plot management, especially for fertilization and understory vegetation. Studies disentangling the agro-environmental impacts of oil palm smallholders' management practices at the plot scale remain scarce. The extent to which smallholders' practices affect both agronomic and environmental performances is still to be investigated with robust in-field studies to provide improvement tracks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the effects of both fertilization and understory vegetation management on soil health and oil palm performances. It explored a gradient of management practices, within homogeneous soil and climate conditions and historical development. The objective was to isolate and decipher the specific effects of some key practices on the overall plantation performances. METHODS: We surveyed 16 ex-plasma oil palm smallholders' 25-year old plots, gathering detailed information on management and implementing field measurements (48 points). For soil health assessment, we applied Biofunctool (R) that consists of nine in-site indicators informing on the soil ability to transform carbon, recycle nutrient and maintain its structure. For the oil palm performances, we relied on conventional appraisal parameters, such as yields, leaf area and nutrient leaf analyses. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted that fertilization, especially potassium, played a significant role in sustaining oil palm performances. Understory vegetation had a direct and positive effect on soil structure maintenance indicators. Soil structure improvement was correlated with enhanced oil palm performances. Those results highlighted that, besides nutritional aspects, increasing plot biodiversity through understory vegetation maintenance was associated with enhanced soil health hence potential greater ecosystem functions. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings have implications in terms of better understanding the effects of combined farming practices on the soil-oil palm continuum. It especially highlighted the key role of understory vegetation to improve soil structure maintenance without competing with oil palms in the studied context.

Abstract: Plants can detect the quality, quantity and direction of light and use it as a signal to adapt their morphogenesis and growth. Thus depending on their light transmission, coloured nets used to protect plants from pests and limit irradiance can also impact plant growth and production. Tomato plants have been grown under blue or red nets transmitting similar photosynthetic yield from transplanting until the end of the fruit harvest to determine the importance of the light spectrum on plant growth, reproductive characteristics and fruit chemical composition. The morphological traits, organ physiology and fruit composition were strongly influenced by net colour. Plants under the red net were taller with a greater leaf area and a shoot to root ratio. An increased blue to red ratio slightly enhanced the reproductive development (visible bud development and 1st flowering) of tomato plants. An increased red to blue ratio enhanced the tomato glucose (17 %) and fructose (6 %) contents, while the citric (5 %) and malic acids (4 %) contents decreased, triggering a higher sugar/acid ratio. A high blue to red light limited organ growth and plant light interception was reduced despite a higher photosynthetic yield and a slight enhancement of the organ appearance rate. In addition, a low blue to red light increased fruit weight at harvest and even if it did not significantly improve fruit yield, it favoured fruit quality as it enhanced the tomato sugar/acid ratio.

Abstract: The effect of nitrogen (N) nutrition on grapevine carbon (C) dynamics has been well studied at the annual scale, but poorly addressed at a pluriannual timescale. The aim of this study was to quantify, in an integrated conceptual framework, the effect of N nutrition on potted grapevine growth and storage over 2 consecutive years. The consequences of using destructive measurements were investigated using a hierarchical Bayesian model. The rate and duration of leaf growth were both positively impacted by the chlorophyll content of the leaves, but they were negatively impacted by the initial carbohydrate measurements, raising a distortion in the estimation of initial reserves. The C production per unit of global radiation depended on the leaf area dynamics. The allocation of dry matter mainly relied on the phenological stage. The present study highlights the importance of using appropriate statistical methods to overcome uncertainties due to destructive measurements. The genericity of the statistical approach presented may encourage its implementation in other agronomy studies. Based on our results, a simple conceptual framework of grapevine pluriannual growth under various N supplies was built. This provides a relevant basis for a future model of C and N balance and responses to N fertilization in grapevine. The pluriannual dynamics of grapevine growth responses to nitrogen supply were quantified using a Bayesian approach to account for statistical errors associated with destructive measurements.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of rubber tree plantations in recent decades has been accompanied by dramatic negative ecological and social impacts. Rubber sector stakeholders consequently engaged in sustainable production of rubber. Despite the lack of harvest during the immature stage following planting, this period plays a key role in future yields. Management practices, particularly fertilization regimes, are used by farmers to shorten the immature period as much as possible. This entails maintaining or even improving the productivity of existing plantations to face the demand for natural rubber. This review focuses specifically on the immature period of rubber tree plantations, as it is the most critical period for nutrient management. We reviewed available knowledge on fertilization practices, soil management, and nutrient dynamics in rubber plantations with the goal of developing a nutrient balance approach for this crop. Our review revealed (1) a notable difference between fertilizer recommendations made by technical institutes and those reported in the scientific literature; (2) that even though nutrient diagnostic methods could help growers adapt the fertilization of rubber trees more than 3years of age, further studies are needed to adapt current methods to the wide range of cultivation areas; and (3) that the nutrient budget approach may be the best way to incorporate the variety of rubber tree cultivation conditions. In conclusion, the nutrient budget method is a promising way to improve the sustainability of rubber plantations through fertilization making it possible to increase nutrient use efficiency. A comprehensive approach based on nutrient budgets requires further in-depth studies to examine nutrient dynamics in a wide range of conditions, including intercropping and logging residue management between clearcutting and replanting.

Abstract: Aim: Nitrogen is a major element conditioning grapevine growth, yield and aromatic profiles of berries and wines. Different tools can be used in order to detect differences in N status of the plant, including direct measurements of soil, plant nitrogen status (eg. petiole; must), or indirect observations of plant nutritional status such as leaf transmittance or reflectance (eg. SPAD; NDVI). However, the relationships between these indicators of nitrogen status and the overall plant functioning over vintages remain poorly known. The present study aimed at quantifying key vegetative and reproductive responses to plant nitrogen status over two successive seasons under different nitrogen supply levels. Methods and results: Potted plants of Sauvignon blanc grafted onto SO4 were grown outdoors in 2017 and 2018 with no water limitation. Four mineral nitrogen fertilization levels (equivalent to 0 kg of N ha(-1) or 0U, 20U, 40U, 80U) and one organic nitrogen fertilization level (40U) were imposed in 2017. These treatments were doubled in 2018 to increase the degree of nitrogen supply and consequently, the range of observed effects on plant growth and yield. Plant nitrogen status (SPAD) was monitored weekly during both growing cycles. Yield components were determined over the two seasons. Lastly, plant carbon status was addressed through dynamic measurement of plant development and photosynthesis, and destructive measurement of dry matter accumulation and carbon storage in annual and perennial organs at flowering, veraison and harvest. The SPAD values progressively decreased under lower N supply (0N) during the first year (from 31 to 16) and they were more than halved between the maximum and the minimum N treatments straight after budburst in year two (40 for 160N and 19 for 0N). Then, the differences in SPAD values among treatments were maintained up to harvest (2018). The gradient of N status resulted in a gradient of berry numbers per inflorescence (from 180 to 34 berries/inflorescence for 80N and 0N, respectively in 2018) and of individual berry dry matter at harvest (from 0.13 to 0.41 g for 160N and 0N, respectively in 2018). Quantitative relationships between N status and the relative reductions (% of reduction per % SPAD decrease) in terms of C gain (leaf area, photosynthesis), C growth (shoot, berry, trunk and root dry matter) and C storage (trunk and root) were fitted at flowering, veraison and harvest. The reduction in C gain under lower N supply was mainly related to the decrease in total leaf area before flowering (-1.64 %). Although the photosynthesis rate tended to decrease under N deficiency over the season, it only poorly contributed to the reduction in C gain. The whole plant C growth was inhibited when N status decreased (-1.13 % at harvest), due to the inhibition of shoot dry matter before veraison (-1.81 %) and to a lower extent, to the lower dry matter in berries (-0.80 %), trunks (-0.42 %) and roots (-0.84 %) at harvest. Part of the reduction in root dry matter was related to the lower starch reserves (-0.31 %) at harvest. Interestingly, starch reserves tended to be higher under organic N supply than mineral N supply. Conclusion: The present results provided a general framework of carbon gain and use over time (within and between seasons) as impacted by N supply levels and form. Such a framework will be useful when building a model of the pluri-annual dynamics of carbon balance related to yield elaboration in grapevines.

Abstract: Rubber plantations have rapidly replaced natural forests (NFs) in Mainland Southeast Asia, yet the relevant impacts on the terrestrial carbon cycle remain uncertain especially with an increase in drought frequency. Our study compared eddy-covariance measurements of carbon and water fluxes from two rubber monoculture plantations (at a northern marginal site and a southern traditional plantation site) with a second-growth NF between 2015 and 2018, and their responses to a prolonged drought during 2015/2016. The NF had higher light use efficiency, water use efficiency and gross primary productivity (GPP, 2.94 +/- 0.41 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) than the northern rubber (NR) monoculture (2.45 +/- 0.17 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)), while lower ecosystem carbon use efficiency (eCUE) caused a lower net ecosystem productivity (NEP, 0.75 +/- 0.25 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to the plantation (1.19 +/- 0.22 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Drought decreased the NF eCUE by 23% with significant carbon uptake restrictions across multiple seasons, while the rubber GPP reduction was only substantial in the warm-dry season with an overall 17% decline in eCUE. The NR site's GPP was mainly controlled by soil water content throughout the year. Higher light availability offset the negative effect of drier conditions on the rubber GPP, resulting in larger carbon uptake compared to the southern plantation (GPP, 2.12 +/- 0.12 kg C m(-2) yr(-1); NEP, 1.07 +/- 0.14 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the NF GPP was mainly restricted by vapor pressure deficit, especially during the drought.

Abstract: Monocultural rubber plantations have replaced tropical forest, causing biodiversity loss. While protecting intact or semi-intact biodiverse forest is paramount, improving biodiversity value within the 11.4 million hectares of existing rubber plantations could offer important conservation benefits, if yields are also maintained. Some farmers practice agroforestry with high-yielding clonal rubber varieties to increase and diversify incomes. Here, we ask whether such rubber agroforestry improves biodiversity value or affects rubber yields relative to monoculture. We surveyed birds, fruit-feeding butterflies and reptiles in 25 monocultural and 39 agroforest smallholder rubber plots in Thailand, the world's biggest rubber producer. Management and vegetation structure data were collected from each plot, and landscape composition around plots was quantified. Rubber yield data were collected for a separate set of 34 monocultural and 47 agroforest rubber plots in the same region. Reported rubber yields did not differ between agroforests and monocultures, meaning adoption of agroforestry in this context should not increase land demand for natural rubber. Butterfly richness was greater in agroforests, where richness increased with greater natural forest extent in the landscape. Bird and reptile richness were similar between agroforests and monocultures, but bird richness increased with the height of herbaceous vegetation inside rubber plots. Species composition of butterflies differed between agroforests and monocultures, and in response to natural forest extent, while bird composition was influenced by herbaceous vegetation height within plots, the density of non-rubber trees within plots (representing agroforestry complexity) and natural forest extent in the landscape. Reptile composition was influenced by canopy cover and open habitat extent in the landscape. Conservation priority and forest-dependent birds were not supported within rubber. Synthesis and applications. Rubber agroforestry using clonal varieties provides modest biodiversity benefits relative to monocultures, without compromising yields. Agroforests may also generate ecosystem service and livelihood benefits. Management of monocultural rubber production to increase inter-row vegetation height and complexity may further benefit biodiversity. However, biodiversity losses from encroachment of rubber onto forests will not be offset by rubber agroforestry or rubber plot management. This evidence is important for developing guidelines around biodiversity-friendly rubber and sustainable supply chains, and for farmers interested in diversifying rubber production.

Abstract: Much effort has been spent on promoting conservation agriculture (CA) in Northern Benin to sustain the transition of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cropping systems toward agroecology. However, its limited adoption by farmers is often ascribed to initial yield penalties during the transition to CA and to trade-offs around crop biomass use. Here, we assess the effect of different CA-based cropping systems promoted in the region on water productivity and cotton yield in a three-year cotton/maize (Zea mays L.) crop rotation during the initial transition phase to CA. Three CA options were assessed combining different levels of soil disturbance and cover, and introducing cover crops to alleviate the biomass trade-offs. Direct seeding (DS), strip tillage (ST), and direct seeding mulched-based cropping systems (DMC) were compared with conventional tillage (CT) from 2017 to 2019 under a dominant soil type in the region, Haplic Lixisols. Two legume species, Stylosanthes guianensis (Aubl.) Sw. and Crotalaria retusa L. were grown as cover crops with maize under ST and DMC. The experiment followed a randomized block design comprising six replicates. After 2-3 years of DMC, the cotton yield advantage with respect to CT increased from 5 % to 7 %. Cotton yield penalties of respectively 11 % in 2018 and 26 % in 2019 were found for DS. ST treatment went from a yield advantage of 8 % in 2017 to a yield penalty of 20 % in 2019. The DMC and CT treatments gave similar and highest boll weights compared to the ST and DS treatments. The treatments had no significant difference regarding the number of bolls per plant. Soil water storage in the upper 30 cm depth and water use efficiency (WUE) were the highest in the plots with the DMC treatment compared to CT, ST, and DS. At 28 days of active vegetative stage (between 34 and 62 days after sowing), the WUE of seed cotton was 0.11 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) under DMC, while it was 0.08, 0.07, and 0.04 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) under DS, CT, and ST, respectively. The performance of DMC at increasing water productivity could be an argument to improve adoptability by farmers in northern Benin who are facing increased weather variability, given that the yield penalties often associated with early transitions to CA were not observed here with full DMC.

Abstract: Pathways for mediating the competing land-use claims of landowners and tenants in oil palm agroforestry systems in Benin's Adja plateau do not consider the diversity of land-management practices. Therefore, we analysed how soil properties and maize yields in those systems are affected by two contrasting categories of land-management practices and fertilisation options. We used a synchronic approach to split these practices and options into two successive steps. In Step 1, referred to as cropped fields, tenants continuously intercrop maize among scattered oil palms. In Step 2, referred to as fallows, the land is densely planted with oil palm, without intercropping. Twelve farmers' fields were selected for this study. Eight represent cropping fields, and four are 15-year-old oil-palm fallows. Cropped field fertilisation treatments consisted of farmyard manure (at 15 and 30 t ha(-1)) and mineral fertiliser (150 kg ha(-1) of N14P18K18S6B1 + 50 kg ha(-1) of urea). We found no significant differences between the N contents and C:N ratios of the two types of fields. However, the numbers and masses of earthworm casts were higher in cropped fields treated with farmyard manure than with mineral fertiliser. Farmyard manure (15 and 30 t ha(-1) rates) also produced significantly higher maize yields (respectively, 2.5 and 3.2 t ha(-1)) than the mineral fertiliser alone (1.9 t of maize per ha). We conclude by discussing N, K and P storage in soil, and recommended use of farmyard manure as an agroforestry practice that will benefit landowners and tenants alike on the Adja plateau.
